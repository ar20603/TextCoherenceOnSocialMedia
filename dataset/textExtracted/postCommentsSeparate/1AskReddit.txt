I pay with the Macy's card, then while still at the register, I immediately pay off the charge with my debit card. I just got 20% off my purchase and I never get a credit card bill. - this also works with JCP and kohl's cards. #11 Permalink When you buy something online, you usually get a chance to enter a promo code before you purchase.

The pump handle on the icon will be on the side of the tank. Update: saw the gas tank one on an older reddit, turns out the handle thing is not consistant. But there IS usually a little arrow next to the icon. Second Update 99% of the time the gas door is opposite of the tailpipe. So far, I have only found that early-mid 2000 Pontiac Vibes break this trend. Third update if there is no arrow, then it most likely is on the passenger's side. I've yet to see one without an arrow that wasn't on the passenger's side #22 Permalink this tip was unpopular, so im changing it This one changed my life.

Shells slip right off #24 Permalink you spill any liquid that will stain on your carpet (red wine, juice, etc), pour some salt on it. Work it into the carpet - just rub it in with your hands.

The fine for this offense (at the university I worked at) was $250, and usually a ban from parking at the university (i.e., booted or towed on sight). College Parking Cheat Code: Anyone who's gone to a college or university knows they usually charge a ridiculous amount of money for parking (usually $300+ for a semester pass or $10+ for the daily passes), a service that should fucking be free for students considering the high cost of education. Fuck them. Buy one daily pass at the beginning of the school year (usually a small paper ticket printed out a machine on the lot), take it home and scan it, photoshop the date for tomorrow, and print. Repeat for the next 4 years. Anyone with even the most rudimentary photoshop skills can pull this off convincingly. Even if your printer is shitty, from behind the tint and glare of a car windshield, it might as well be a 7-11 receipt. I did this for 2 years at a UC and saved hundreds of dollars. The new list of real-life cheat codes based on the top scoring comments from both the new list created by MrCassiBro and the old list Number Cheat #31 Permalink When you go to a restaurant where they bring you your drink in a cup/glass, ask for no ice or for ice on the side. Often what they do is load your drink with ice so that it seems as if there's more in there, especially at bars. #32 Permalink When you pour soda, pour it along the side of the cup instead of directly into it - like they do at bars. This keeps alot of the "fizzyness" in the drink and as a result, it keeps a lot of the texture and flavor. #33 Permalink If you need to withdraw more money than your limit, if you do it quickly enough, you can withdraw your limit twice from the same ATM and sometimes the one next to it before it stops you from withdrawing any more. #34 Permalink If you back up the toilet at work or someones house with no plunger available, look for liquid hand soap. Dump some in the toilet and wait about five minutes and flush again. The soap lubricates the nasties so they'll flush away. If its still clogged, find a way to dump hot water in the toilet, as it can have the same effect. Use the trash can or something. If its still clogged, kick the door open and run like hell. Find a new job or new friends. You just left their toilet full of hot soapy shit soup, you asshole. #35 Permalink When I am in a large shopping centre (mall) I take a photo of the information board on my phone so I can look up how to get to stores without having to go back to the board #36 Permalink When commenting on something, whether it be reddit, facebook, etc. finish typing your comment, stop, re-read it twice and then ask yourself what you are trying to accomplish with said comment before posting. #37 Permalink When you finish showering, use your hand as a squeegee(?) To get excess water off your body. It makes drying much faster and your towel will also be dry sooner. #38 Permalink Don't be a dick #39 Permalink if you gently rock back and forth while pooping it will take significantly less time and make it easier to pass more "troublesome" movements. Best. Lifehack. Ever. #40 Permalink Try and get in good with the clerks/secretaries of where ever you work or do business. Those are the people who can most easily cover your ass when you fuck up. #50 Permalink 1st Date Cheat Code for MEN: Never tell a girl where you’re going or how to dress. Instead, tell her to "dress for a first date with a guy she really likes". Now, pick three places you'd like to go: someplace fun and active (bowling, pool, mini golf, go-kart racing, ballgame, etc), something romantic and classy (nice restaurant, upscale lounge, art gallery opening) and something in between (nice bar, coffee shop, comedy club). Now, when you pick her up, let the way she's dressed decide which you’re going to do: If she's wearing something sexy and revealing (dress, high heels, low cut top, etc.) than she wants to go somewhere classy and romantic. If she's sporting some jeans, tennis shoes or flip-flops, and a tee, the bowling ally or pool hall may be a good bet. If she's wearing jeans, high heeled boots, and nice top or blouse, than she's not really jonesing for the super romance treatment, and she put in more effort than mini golf deserves (eighteen holes of mini golf in heels... seriously?), so a comedy club or some place with live music is a good choice. And never, EVER, do a movie on the first date! EDIT: Men: You're going to wear a pair of CLEAN, NEAT jeans, a pressed stylish LONG sleeve button down shirt, nice shoes or boots (try to avoid tennis shoes of sneakers). Works for ANY occasion! #51 Permalink If you don't know if a baby is a boy or a girl ask the baby "Whats your name?" And the parent will answer. That way no angry mom or dad getting mad because you cant tel because they dress there baby in green. #52 Permalink Wear a condom #53 Permalink On flights, if you are fighting for an arm rest with a stranger. bring your arm (the one thats on the same side the arm rest you want) up to your mouth and sneeze/cough. Then place it by the armrest. The other person will move their arm. Has had 100% success rate. #53 Permalink To stop a sneeze, tickle the roof of your mouth with your tongue. #55 Permalink Avoid forgetting something in the morning by placing it in your shoes. (works best if you wear the same pair every day.) #56 Permalink Give yourself half an hour of downtime in the morning, between being ready to leave and leaving, and your day won't feel so rushed. #57 Permalink Simply put: Don't ever overlay your reality onto someone else's reality. Example: Person A: "Oh man, I'm having a really hard time recently, I can't seem to get along with my mom." Person B: "Yeah, I know how that is, I just talked to my mom yesterday, and she was like...." etc. Let Person A reflect on their moment of hardship, stand back, listen, be there for them, but don't interject with your own thoughts/emotions about your own situation. #58 Permalink When you're talking to someone and can't tell if they are interested in the subject/their mind is elsewhere, cross your arms. If they cross theirs as well, they are truly listening. #59 Permalink Men of all shapes and sizes: Wear clothing that fits. Nothing looks trashier than a guy wearing a shirt two sizes too big or a pair of uncomfortable looking pants. This applies to fat guys too, don't try to hide your flub by wearing large t-shirts and jackets as they only make you look bigger! Instead get fitted and wear clothing that fits you. #60 Permalink Listen to music when doing stuff by yourself, it will make the most mundane task feel awesome. #61 Permalink If you want to get into a sold out concert simply go to the store and buy two bags of ice. Walk up to the front of the line and say, "I'm the ice guy". Free concert, minus the price of the ice. #62 Permalink If you are quitting something e.g. smoking, drinking etc. Everytime you feel the urge to do said addiction : Go for a run, do 20 sit ups, 20 push ups etc. This way you can start to associate exercise with quitting and you get fitter the more you quit which can make you feel better #63 Permalink Shut the fuck up. Wait for the lawyer. #64 Permalink No matter where you are in public, make it a habit of noting every reflective surface around you. Usually you can find one that gives a decent view of who is behind you. If you're at work, strategically place cds or other reflective objects so you can always see whose standing behind you in your cube. #65 Permalink ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A Start #66 Permalink Don't waste money buying expensive binoculars. Simply stand closer to the object you wish to view. #67 Permalink Before you take a dookie, throw in a piece or two of toilet paper in the toilet bowl to reduce/avoid splasing and that kerplunk noise. #68 Permalink Women can push the poop out with their fingers properly inserted into their vagina. #69 Permalink If you're shaving your balls, try to maintain an erection during the entire shave. The whole job is a lot easier with your penis out of the way. #70 Permalink If you have crushing chest pain, call 911 first. Then chew some aspirin. I work in cardiology. #71 Permalink When you eat hard shell taco's, do it over your nachos. That way when they disintegrate, you can eat the bits you lost with your nachos. #72 Permalink If you need to store cookies or pastries for a few days in a tupperware or other type of container, to prevent them from getting dry and brittle, put a piece of bread in the container right along with the cookies. It will keep them very soft and moist. Sometimes, if you burn the cookies a little and they seem very tough and crunchy, leaving them in a container with the bread over night will actually soften them up and make them better than when they came out of the oven! #73 Permalink Kill a boner within 30 seconds by squeezing your thighs together really tight. (Guys only). #74 Permalink Walk on the sides of stairs to avoid/reduce creaks. #75 Permalink Talk to everyone like you would your best mate, and smile. #76 Permalink Sprinkle some salt on your napkin coaster at the bar.. your beer won't stick to it EVERY FUGGIN TIME.... #77 Permalink To get through tech support quickly with an ISP, choose the option for becoming a new customer. Then when you get there ask to transfer to tech support. Usually they won't put you on hold because they see the number coming from the new customer line. #78 Permalink Pull on your hair in the shower, if it squeaks you already shampooed it. #79 Permalink Don't announce that you are having a kid till the second trimester. #80 Permalink When studying arts at university, take notes on your prof's political/philosophical ideologies and worldviews. Regurgitate in essays and on exams for an A grade. Also, margins, font, font size, etc. are incredibly important. Never neglect these. #81 Permalink Never include #41-#49 in a list of real-life cheat codes on reddit. Some things to remember: If you liked a tip, upvote its original author. It's only fair.

I like the one about the Rugrats. Ever wondered just how Angelica could talk to the babies? Angelica is the only one who can talk to the babies because they are a figment of her imagination. She is spoilt, sad and lonely, because her Mother is constantly working and has no time for her. Her relationship with her Dad is superficial and unsubstantial, no real love is ever shown to her. So how did it come about that Angelica would have to imagine these babies? Tommy died soon after child birth, a fact reflected by Stu never leaving the basement, inventing toys that his son will never play with. Chuckie died in the car crash along with his Mum, also reflected in the actions of his father; the crash has made him a pathetic nervous wreck most of the time. Most interesting is Phil and Lil. There never where any twins, there was just one baby. However this baby was a still born, and Angelica never knew the sex of the still born, so she invented twins of different genders. Sadly, Angelica never uses her imaginary friends to comfort or entertain her, instead she is mean and nasty to them. She has invented this relationship with these babies so she can vent her frustrations of being a spoilt, lonely brat who has seen much hardship from these unfortunate parents; frustrations that can't be satisfied by a typical childhood relationship with a doll, albeit a Cynthia one. EDIT: Wow. Went to bed and there was about 25 upvotes. Woke up and now there's quite a lot more, and a subreddit created! Great success! Will read them all, goosebumps will be had. And I know that the majority of these theories aren't water-tight (including mine...), but come on, it's fun to speculate! EDIT II: I have realized how my question could be interpreted the wrong way, hence numerous and humorous links to this. Indeed, my mind is blown. EDIT III: OK I'm heading off now, and by the time I get back this thread will have disappeared into the depths of Askreddit. Thanks for the amazing response! I know my theory was rubbish, but there are some absolutely amazing ones, my favorite being the Kill Bill one. Bill is not dead!. Don't forget to check out and post in /r/fantheories!
So a little of a personal story here. I happen to have a very common hispanic name, also I served in the Marines who on two different occasions lost personal information of mine to include my social security number. The state of Florida was able to pull $25K out of my personal bank account with only my very common last name and social. It was for someone trying to collect way past due child support. Neither Florida Child Support Collections or Bank of America bothered to check the first or middle name on the account. Much less the birthday, residence, or any other personal information. This all happened with out any notification. All the sudden I had nothing in my account, and it was up to me to figure out how to live for the next 3 months while BOA and Florida unfucked my shit. I realize its hard to pin down some of these worthless child support dodging assholes, but that does not mean that you can just remove funds from an account without matching every detail. Fortunately I have friends and family who helped me get a lawyer, and float me some money until all of this was figured out. However without them, I would have been up shit creek without a paddle. Sorry for the long story. Edit: Spelling
Obviously im going to use one. Back in highschool i dated a girl for 6 months before she decided it wasn't working out anymore and she cheated on me with about 6 guys and stole my iPhone and wallet to buy drugs. I wanted to report her to the police like my parents encouraged me to and to prevent me from doing such her brother jumped me while I was walking home with his friends and busted open my lip pretty badly and threatened to kill me if i reported him or his sister (this is South Florida, so i believed he would do it). My dad got a new job and we moved to a new city but i was still pissed about this whole situation so i did the next best thing. I created two fake facebook account of a random hot girl and guy, spent some time making it look legit with friends and such and added her brother on facebook with the girl and my ex with the guy. It wasnt too long before he started flirting "me" up and tried his best to get in this girls pants. on the other hand, having already courted my now ex i knew exactly what to say to charm her to the point that she was in love with me. This is where it all begins to get fun. I started a sexting relationship between the brother and sister with me as the intermediate thanks to google voice. Both of them had fairly typical south florida bodies so nothing really gave anything away and i did a fair amount of photoshopping to remove identifiers in the room that may give away anything. This went on for about a month and a half totaling about 200 or so nudes between the two of them when i decided to reveal the curtain and send a group of unedited pictures that included key identifiers (face and rooms). Oh holy jesus how shit went down. I only wish i had some way to see how they reacted. Friends who still lived there told me her brother moved in with his dad that week and that they no longer spoke. All in all, about 4 months till i got my revenge but it was amazing. EDIT: YOU GODDAMN SONS OF BITCHES. Someone told my Ex about it and now she finally knows forsure that it was me. HAHAHAH. Sucks for her i now live 2000 miles away for college but jesus christ reddit. Dont go shooting your mouth off.
Friend and I were fishing at a local creek when my friends brother pulled up. Being the dick he normally was he started throwing rocks in the creek to scare the fish and then he threw my friends bike in the creek. We were 13 at the time, my friend was crying and I felt so bad. I jumped into the creek and got his bike out, told him we would get his brother back. About a month later we were fishing again and it was the dead of summer. I told my friend today is the day we get his brother back. Caught a 2/3 pound carp, threw it up on the side of the bank and left it there until we were done fishing. At the end of the night went back to his place his brothers car was sitting on the street, we took the carp sliced it open and threw it under the drivers seat and rolled his windows 3/4 up. The next morning when we woke and left I forgot about what we had done. Well when I rode past JT's car I noticed the window was kind of black and then I took a closer look it was covered in flies. I actually got scared because I did not expect to a window caked with flies. By the time I got home I was laughing in tears because his brother was always such a dick to us. Fast forward to baseball practice about 3 days later, friend had a black eye but smiled at me when we made eye contact. His brother flipped out and ran into his house and punched him in the face. His mom flipped out on his brother, brother was grounded for the rest of summer. His mom said that my friend would never do such a thing and he played along and acted as if he had no idea. Apparently the smell never really left the car. We nicknamed his brother lord of the flies.
Edit: (Woah obligatory front page) Thanks chefs, cooks and homecookers- lots of great tips! Here are some of the top tips: Use good tools- Things are better and easier when you use good pans and knives. Whenever you're sautéing, frying, or wok-ing don't crowd the pan. Prep all of your stuff before starting to cook. Read the whole recipe before you begin cooking. Meat continues cooking after you take it off the grill Butter Awesome steak technique from ironicouch "My friend's mother taught me how to cook steak a few months back, so far it has not failed me. You have to make sure your steak is dry, use a paper towel to dry it off. Heat the skillet before putting the steak on, you want to hear it sizzle when you place it in the pan. Rub the steak down with just a little olive oil and some sea salt and then place it in the pan for until it starts browning, so it doesn't take long on the stove, then put in the oven at 400 degrees F, for 10 minutes or even less depending on how rare you like it. Everyone has their own method, but this was the simplest way I have heard it being made, and it always tastes fantastic." Another great steak cooking tip from FirstAmendAnon "Alright, this is a great method, but leaves out a few important details. Here's the skinny on getting you perfect steakhouse quality steaks at home: Buy a thick cut of meat like a porterhouse. If its more than 2" thick it's usually better. Look for a lot of marbling (little white lines of fat through the meat). The more the better. Stick the meat unwrapped on a rack in the fridge overnight (watch out for cross-contamination! make sure your fridge is clean). This ages the meat and helps dry it out. Then like an hour before you cook take it out of the fridge, pat it down with paper towels, and leave it out until your ready to season. Preheat your oven to really hot, like 500F, and stick your (ovensafe!) pan in there. That will ensure your pan is super hot and get a sear on your meat quickly. Season both sides of the steak with coarse salt and like a teaspoon of oil. I find peanut oil to be better than olive oil but it doesn't really make much difference. Pan out of the oven using a thick oven mitt. Stick your steak in there, it should hiss loudly and start to sear immedietly. This is the goodness. 2 minutes on both sides, then stick about three tablespoons of room temperature butter and three sprigs of fresh rosemary on top of the steak and throw that baby in the oven. after about 3 minutes, open the oven (there will be lots of smoke, run your fan), and flip the steak. 2 or three more minutes, pull it out. If you like it more on the well done side, leave it a little longer. Do not leave it for more than like 5 minutes because you might as well just make hamburgers. Take it off the heat. Using a wooden spoon or large soup spoon tilt the pan and repeatedly spoon the butter and juices onto the steak. Baste in all its glory. Let the meat rest for about five minutes. I use that time to make the plate prettified. Mash potatoes or cheesy grits on the bottom. Brussel sprouts on the side. Maybe some good goats cheese on top of the steak. Be creative. This method is guaranteed to produce a bomb diggity steak. Like, blowjob-inducing 100% of the time. It's really high-heat and ingredient driven though, so be careful, and spend that extra $5 on the good cut of meat. EDIT: As a couple of people below have mentioned, a well-seasoned cast iron pan is best for this method. Also, the 5th bullet is slightly unclear. You take the hot pan out of the oven, place it on the stovetop with the stovetop on full heat, and sear the steak for 2min ish on both sides. Then cut off the stovetop and put the steak in the oven."
If you have no idea what I'm talking about: Original Post from three months ago and Update 1. HuffPo Writeup TLDR: I traveled. Reddit gave me things to do. I did them Hey Reddit, I've had a crazy, crazy summer and have you guys to thank. My travels brought me across the US and Canada, through rural Thailand, to Seoul and Sydney. Over the last three months I have met hundreds of redditors and gone on some cool adventures. Highlights include: Carwashing for oliversmom - you can read more about Oliver here Mr. Duck Stickers left everywhere Portrait painted Help a dude move Barcraft, Seattle Weeding (Zajoba pictured) Aerial Tour, Seattle Motion Capture for Valve Ride an Elephant Teaching English, Thailand GSL Code S Final, Seoul Tastosis signatures for Redditor John the Translator Picture for a redditor couple Interview Moving a couch: hardmode, Denver Giant spiders in Australia Pubcrawl, Sydney Forensics guest lecture, Sydney Toured the NYSE Rocket Museum, Huntsville Rappeling Eat a "Gripper", Calgary Attend the 100th Calgary Stampede (also, barcraft) Waterfight, Calgary Bobsledding, Calgary Letters, Edmonton (yet to be delivered) Originally I was planning on traveling through till the end of July but surprise tooth ache had me grounded early (turns out I need my wisdom teeth removed). I've been home for the last week, catching up on sleep and getting organized for the upcoming school year (which starts next week). I also donated the money I raised (via reddit) for filming costs since I managed to stay underbudget all trip (mainly by living off of the hospitality of redditors instead of staying in hostels). I'm interested in doing something similar next summer, but on a bigger scale/actually organized. Something where you could vote on where to send me a on week to week basis. In the mean time I'm going to work on turning the footage I took this summer into something (short documentary or music video or something). I just wanted to thank everyone once again, -Daniel / 'Reddit Travel Guy' EDIT: I'll be doing an AMA this Sunday starting at noon PST Obligatory link to the subreddit I kept Preview of footage from thailand
So I've been watching HBO's Rome and Generation Kill simultaneously and it's lead me to fantasize about traveling back in time with modern troops and equipment to remove that self-righteous little twat Octavian (Augustus) from power. Let's say we go back in time with a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), since the numbers of members and equipment is listed for our convenience in this Wikipedia article, could we destroy all 30 of Augustus' legions? We'd be up against nearly 330,000 men since each legion was comprised of 11,000 men. These men are typically equipped with limb and torso armor made of metal, and for weaponry they carry swords, spears, bows and other stabbing implements. We'd also encounter siege weapons like catapults and crude incendiary weapons. We'd be made up of about 2000 members, of which about half would be participating in ground attack operations. We can use our four Abrams M1A1 tanks, our artillery and mechanized vehicles (60 Humvees, 16 armored vehicles, etc), but we cannot use our attack air support, only our transport aircraft. We also have medics with us, modern medical equipment and drugs, and engineers, but we no longer have a magical time-traveling supply line (we did have but the timelords frowned upon it, sadly!) that provides us with all the ammunition, equipment and sustenance we need to survive. We'll have to succeed with the stuff we brought with us. So, will we be victorious? I really hope so because I really dislike Octavian and his horrible family. Getting Atia will be a bonus. Edit - Prufrock451 Big thanks to Prufrock451 for bringing this scenario to life in a truly captivating and fascinating manner. Prufrock clearly has a great talent, and today it appears that he or she has discovered that they possess the ability to convey their imagination - and the brilliant ideas it contains - to people in a thoroughly entertaining and exciting way. You have a wonderful talent, Prufrock451, and I hope you are able to use it to entertain people beyond Reddit and the internet. Thank you for your tremendous contribution to this thread. Mustard-Tiger Wow! Thank you for gifting me Reddit Gold! I feel like a little kid who's won something cool, like that time my grandma made me a robot costume out of old cereal boxes and I won a $10 prize that I spent on a Thomas the Tank Engine book! That might seem as if I'm being unappreciative, but watching this topic grow today and seeing people derive enjoyment from all the different ideas and scenarios that have been put forward by different posters has really made my day, and receiving Reddit Gold from Mustard-Tiger is the cherry on the top that has left me feeling just as giddy as that little kid who won a voucher for a bookshop. Again, thank you very much, Mustard-Tiger. I'm sure I will make good use of Reddit Gold. Thank you to all the posters who've recommended books, comics and movies about alternative histories and time travel. I greatly appreciate being made aware of the types of stories and ideas that I really enjoy reading or watching. It's always nice to receive recommendations from people who share your interest in the same things. Edit - In my head the magical resupply system only included sustenance, ammo and replacement equipment like armor. Men and vehicles would not be replaced if they died or were destroyed. I should have made that clear in my OP. Okay, let's remove the magical resupply line, instead replacing it with enough equipment and ammo to last for, say, 6 months. Could we destroy all of the Roman Empire in that space of time before our modern technological advantages ceased to function owing to a lack of supplies? Edit 3 - Perhaps I've over estimated the capabilities of the Roman forces. If we remove the tanks and artillery will we still win? We now have troops, their weapons, vehicles for mobility (including transport helicopters), medics and modern medicine, and engineers and all the other specialists needed to keep a MEU functional.
DAY 1 The 35th MEU is on the ground at Kabul, preparing to deploy to southern Afghanistan. Suddenly, it vanishes. The section of Bagram where the 35th was gathered suddenly reappears in a field outside Rome, on the west bank of the Tiber River. Without substantially prepared ground under it, the concrete begins sinking into the marshy ground and cracking. Colonel Miles Nelson orders his men to regroup near the vehicle depot - nearly all of the MEU's vehicles are still stripped for air transport. He orders all helicopters airborne, believing the MEU is trapped in an earthquake. Nelson's men soon report a complete loss of all communications, including GPS and satellite radio. Nelson now believes something more terrible has occurred - a nuclear war and EMP which has left his unit completely isolated. Only a few men have realized that the rest of Bagram has vanished, but that will soon become apparent as the transport helos begin circling the 35th's location. Within an hour, the 2,200 Marines have regrouped, stunned. They are not the only moderns transported to Rome. With them are about 150 Air Force maintenance and repair specialists. There are about 60 Afghan Army soldiers, mostly the MEU's interpreters and liaisons. There are also 15 U.S. civilian contractors and one man, Frank Delacroix, who has spoken to no one but Colonel Nelson.
Today on the train I sat next to a woman who was angry that I sat next to her because she wanted the two seats to herself. As I sat there she kept mouthing under her breath how she just wanted to sit there alone... blah blah blah. Despite the fact that I wanted to tell her that it was public transportation and she needed to get over it I kept my mouth shut. A few minutes later a large woman with a large purse comes and stands in the same car I was in. I get her attention and tell her that she could have my seat. She huffs and puffs her way to me and I help her sit down while grinning at the angry woman who was upset I'd sat beside her. I enjoyed watching her head almost explode from anger as the other large woman's rolls and purse pressed against her for the rest of the ride. Anyone else have any of those subtle revenge stories? Edit: of course the one time I don't check reddit, because I think my story was lame and won't get more than five comments, it takes off. I am looking forward to reading all these stories.... Oh and I'd like to thank all the people that made this possible... my producer, all the guys in Fresno, Melvin, all the haters who said I'd never make it, Phil Collins, OAG, GGG, the White House... yadda yadda yadda... Edit again: This lady is a regular and a known seat hog. I've seen her get into arguments before with people because she wants two seats to herself. Everyone pays to ride the train so if there is a seat open then it's up for grabs.
I was working as a manager in a big nightclub about a year ago. I dont wear a uniform, but have a radio and run the security team. The venue has a great smoking section that looks out onto the street. One night the venue was packed so I did my usual roam making sure that there were no problems, however it wasg too packed to walk through the smoking section, so I walked down the street instead, but could still very easily see into the smoking section. One guy stares me down, then calls me over, and starts swearing at me for no reason and telling me that "pieces of shit like you could never even get into a venue like this". He obviously had no idea I was the manager, however I didn't want to have security get into a fight inside with him. The guy kept telling me he would punch me out etc. and was clearly trying to look macho to impress someone. So I agreed and told him to come and meet me outside and he could even have a free swing. He puts his drink down, takes off his jacket and storms outside. Once he walked outside, I walked back inside and told security not to let him back in. The look on his face when he realised I ran the place was priceless, and then the realisation that he couldnt get back into the club was amazing. It was the easiest and most fun removal I have ever done.
Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tenoq/reddit_my_friends_call_me_a_scumbag_because_i/ Okay, the past month and a half has been insane. Like I said in my last post, the code was originally signed to only run on the desktop that I was assigned, and also required a password upon starting. I felt secure in that they couldn't steal and rip the code and fire everyone. I then went to my manager and told him what I was doing. He asked me (In Dutch...) "Is the program still on the work desktop, and did you do it on company time?" I replied yes, and yes. I was promptly fired and expelled from the building. Once I left, I called my bosses superior (? or inferior?? the one higher...) and left him a voice mail saying what happened and that my boss fired me for it, but I thought he was being close minded and not open to advancing the company. I also got a call from my manager, telling me I have to give him the password... I told him I am no longer employed and am not required to any longer. I get a call from my bosses boss, and he asks to have a meeting with me to discuss what actually happened and if it is true that it could save money, he would listen. but I was hellbent on refusing to give out the password. Not to be mean/defensive, but the code was not designed for anyone to use, it was very primitive in the way it had to be setup. I didn't want to be liable for someone using it incorrectly. I met with him a week later, we discussed over tea about the program. I asked if I was doing anything wrong or immoral, and he said that the only issue was that I coded it on company time when I wasn't supposed too, and that the app not only was fine (no requirement to have it done by a person), but also saved the money lots and lots of money and they never even realized it. (They would have had to hire more people to handle the load, but didn't because everything was getting done.) Once we talked about it, he said I was very talented and asked why I worked in the line of work I do instead of software engineering, I replied that I found this job first and was making such great money-- which he didn't expect, and asked me how much I was making, me telling him the true amount. He was floored and cracked up laughing, I made more than my boss (but not the guy I was talking too). He told me he would love to give me a job doing software engineering for the entire companies systems. I agreed only if that the current employees wouldn't be fired and would be put into different places in the company. We came to a compromise that some of the useless people (There were a few...) would be let go (these people are morons beyond belief), but that he could find jobs for the rest (Translation was a big one, since us Dutch people have a culture of learning others languages, sales, HR and other departments, and a few of them were offered training for the jobs. A handful was kept on the original team but their job was changed from manual input to now they work with the tool I built. As far as I know, the bonus program was slashed a lot, but they're still making more bonus than before I bet since I was taking it all) So now I am a lead software engineer over my own department, making the same base pay as I was making base+bonus previously. (No bonus, unfortunately haha) Most other workers moved departments or changed jobs in their department, so most people got a good deal. Except my boss. They were upset with him before this, and were even more upset after him. He was notoriously a bad manager and he was fired over this. Oh well. They hired one of the previous people on my team to take over his job :) TL;DR IT WORKED OUT FOR 99% OF THE PEOPLE. EDIT: one thing is worse: my new desk chair sucks
Reposting this top-level because it was buried under a shitty comment: There is an answer to the question "Why is it so bad?" The answer is because the submission titles on this site suck. Very, very badly. They're generally non-descriptive and useless. People use submission titles as punchlines to a joke, not as an actual title. If a submission is titled "Look what I found", and it's a picture of a gold dubloon, what are you going to search for when you look for it 2 months later? "Gold coin", "gold dubloon", or something. You're not going to search for "Look what I found", because a) You won't have remembered that title, and b) That would turn up about a million results. Go to a subreddit that enforces submission titles (try the SFW-Porn network, they generally have very good titles), and try searching for something (restricted to that subreddit of course). I guarantee you'll get what you're looking for, if it exists. I've been saying this for a long time, but I'll say it again: Reddit should have a system which allow users to tag submissions with keywords, like "gold coin", "dubloon", and other descriptive words, which would then be weighted heavily in search results, based on how many times a post was tagged with a certain phrase or word. If 20 people tag a post with "gold coin", that will be weighted very heavily in the search results, and will probably be the #1 result when someone searches for "gold coin", even though the submission contained none of those words and just linked to an image hosted on imgur. The tags would be hidden from the public for the first hour or two (same as the vote count), so as not to encourage the same type of hivemind bias that exists with the voting system.
As a man that has reached the ripe old age of 48 I can promise you I have seen some shit go down. This one totally takes the cake for me though. I was waiting out front of a truck stop back in the mid 80's. Sitting on a park bench with a guy that had a big Rottweiler kinda dog on a leash with him. I tried to make small talk but he was quite a sourpuss. So we sat in silence for a few minutes until the most unexpected thing I have ever seen, happened right before my very eyes. While we were sitting there a big 18 wheeler pulls in without a trailer (bobtail) so he parks right up front like a normal car would. Inside the cab of the truck with the driver is a little monkey. The dance for the organ grinder kind. I think they are called Rhesus monkeys perhaps. Well the dog spots this lil monkey and proceeds to go apeshit over it. Lunging at the end of his leash and barking at the top of his lungs. Generally making a real spectacle of himself to say the least. The driver is obviously upset, but not nearly as much as the monkey is. Actually upset may be the wrong adjective to use for the monkey though. In retrospect I think eagerly aggressive may be a more appropriate description for his disposition. He was pacing the dashboard back and forth. Never taking his eyes off of this very aggravating dog. The driver opens his little triangle window that they don't make on cars anymore. The ones made for smokers back in the day. He yells out to this douche bag to call his dog off because it is upsetting his monkey. The guy laughs and says no way (I told you he was a jerk didn't I?). Says that his dog ain't bothering nobody. The dog hasn't shut up since he laid eyes on the monkey. I promise you he is bothering everybody for several blocks around. Now here's where things start to get interesting. The driver says that if he doesn't call his dog off he's gonna let his monkey loose on that dog. Douche bag laughs and says that his dog would eat that monkey alive. Upon hearing this the driver leans over and reaches into his glove box I guess. Pulls out one of those tiny baseball bats like you used to get at Astroworld or carnivals, and places it in the monkeys hand. The monkey obviously knows what's about to go down because he is now trying to squeeze out of that little triangular window I mentioned earlier. This monkey has murder in his eyes if I have ever seen it. Driver hollers "Last chance to save your dog's ass man." In response douche bag lets his dog off of the leash. Now we have a situation that has escalated to the point where we have a dog jumping up at the window and a monkey screaming profanities right back at him. Well, the driver finally rolls down the regular window and out leaps all kinds of miniature primate hell. The dog never knew what hit him. Quick as a flash this monkey is riding on the back of this dog's neck. His two back feet all wrapped up in his neck fur with one hand hanging onto an ear. The other hand as you may have guessed by now is steadily and mercilessly raining down blows about this dog's head and face. I mean hard blows. You can hear them whap whap whap. Well it only took a moment for the dog to realize he was in way over his head. He bolts yelping bloody murder as he runs away at full speed. I mean this dog is running so fuckin hard he's throwing up tufts of grass and dirt as soon as he leaves pavement. The monkey still riding him and beating on him the whole time. Douche bag acts like he wants to fight now but several people including myself stepped in to stop that nonsense. In a couple of minutes or so the little monkey comes loping back with his little bat still in hand, and leaps up into the still open window of the truck to await his master who has gone on into the store. That wanker ran off to try to go find his dog, but I don't know if he ever did. My ride showed up and I had to go. Never again in this lifetime will I see something so totally crazy and unexpected like that. I am both fortunate and humble to have been so privileged to be present for such an event. So Reddit, please do tell. What's your craziest thing you have ever seen in public? TL:DR Small monkey beats the shit out of large dog.
Was having a new exhaust put onto my Subaru by a small specialty shop in Buffalo, NY. We dropped it off and then said we would just go walk around for a couple hours till it was done. Staff advised us not too as it was a rough area...we were 19, and from Canada, whats the worst that could happen? After walking through a couple blocks of burnt out hoses, and straight out of the movies (for us) ghetto w decided to turn around and get back to the shop ASAP! We walk around a corner only to see a group of 5 large, thugish looking young black men ahead of us, they notice us, turn and walk in our direction. Instant brick shitting...do we run...do we plead for our lives? We decide to do the Canadian thing and just keep walking like nothings going to happen. The "gang" reaches us after a few seconds, kind of does a half circle around the two of us, there is no escape, only robbery or death. What appears to be the leader makes contact "Yo, we got a question for you guys!". We sheepishly reply"uhhh yea?"
UPDATE: Wow... Just wow. 14 thousand comments and counting. I'm humbled and grateful for every one of the comments, upvotes and the endless amounts of music suggestions. Currently the most upvoted comment isn't a song suggestion but rather a suggestion to listen to the music from the beginnings of its orgins. Here's the original comment below as submitted by GiraffeKiller- "This is like introducing an Alien to the music of Earth. I wouldn't know where to start. Once you're through your kick on Classical, I might start with music from the 50's and progress through each decade. You can really see the growth of modern music like that." I think it's a wonderful idea, and will be blogging about my journey into the world of music. As many of you have pointed out; music didn't start in the 50's, so I'm going to start with the earliest written form of music… I'm going to start with Guillaume de Machaut's Agnus Dei. (Composed sometime between 1313 and 1365) I am still posting my top 5 next week... It will be a difficult task considering all the submissions. This week I am going to re-watch my favorite film of all time, Baraka. This will be my first time being able to hear the soundtrack of the film. I will be posting about that as well. Also for all of those asking- the hearing aids I got is the Phonak Naida S Premium. Again, thank you for all the kind words and shares! Even if you’re not hearing music for the first time ever, I suggest looking through the suggestions and expanding your musical tastes. You never know how much more days you have left to hear.... Trust me on this one, you don’t want to miss out on a great song. I've never understood it. My whole life I've seen hearing people make a fool of themselves singing their favorite song or gyrating on the dance floor. I've also seen hearing people moved to tears by a single song. That was the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around. I was born profoundly deaf and all music sounded like trash through my hearing aids. That is until a couple days ago when I put on a new pair of hearing aids for the first time in years. The first thing I heard was my shoe scraping across the carpet; it startled me. I have never heard that before and out of ignorance, I assumed it was too quiet for anyone to hear. I sat in the doctor's office frozen as a cacophony of sounds attacked me. The whir of the computer, the hum of the AC, the clacking of the keyboard, and when my best friend walked in I couldn't believe that he had a slight rasp to his voice. He joked that it was time to cut back on the cigarettes. That night, a group of close friends jump-started my musical education by playing Mozart, Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Sigur Ros, Radiohead, Elvis, and several other popular legends of music. Being able to hear the music for the first time ever was unreal. I realized that my old hearing aids were giving me a distorted version of music. they were not capable of distributing higher frequencies with clarity, instead it was just garbled gibberish. When Mozart's Lacrimosa came on, I was blown away by the beauty of it. At one point of the song, it sounded like angels singing and I suddenly realized that this was the first time I was able to appreciate music. Tears rolled down my face and I tried to hide it. But when I looked over I saw that there wasn't a dry eye in the car. I finally understood the power of music. Obviously, I did the only sensible thing and went on a binge of music. Below are my top 5 favorites from my limited exposure to the world of sound. Mozart's Lacrimsoa The soundtrack to Eleven Eleven… I can see how this comes off as narcissistic, it being my own film and all but it's such a personal work that when I listened to it for the first time I broke down. I felt like I was truly seeing the film for the first time ever. I'm grateful that Cazz was able to capture the tone perfectly. We discussed the film and specific scenes with essay-sized reasoning/deliberations on what should be conveyed. The critical response to the film surprised me and I still didn't quite get it until seeing the visual images coupled with the soundtrack. Sig Ros's Staralfur IL Postino-Luis Bacalov Minnesota's A Bad Place Ironically enough, I'm turning my hearing aids off more often than before because most sounds are even more annoying and the only times I have it on is when talking to people or listening to music/birds. Silence is still my favorite sound. When I turn my aids off my thoughts become more clear and it's absolutely peaceful. I hope that one day hearing people get the opportunity to experience utter silence. What exactly changed between my old hearing aids and my new ones? My previous hearing aids were only 4 years old but technology has gotten cheaper and better at an exponential rate since then. Before, I could almost hear the low frequencies at a hearing person’s level, but not as crisp... higher notes on the other hand, I didn’t hear at all. I never realized how little of a range my hearing aids picked up compared to hearing people until a telecommunications class in college. We were learning about radio equipment and the guest professor told us about how high human ears can hear and also compared to various animals. He turned around and turned the dial down to the lower pitches. I could still hear nearly all the low frequencies like rest of the class. When he turned the dial in the opposite direction, I blanked out at about 40% and the rest of the class stopped between 90-100%. It’s an odd feeling learning something so profound about yourself at twenty one... But it’s not as odd as the things I can hear now. It was during Lacrimosa that I realized I was truly hearing pitches I’ve never experienced before. It was like seeing a color I’ve never seen before. I honestly never thought I would really be able to hear my own soundtracks because I have accepted my deafness, I have always been and still am grateful for all I've been blessed with so it was never a big deal to me. Now... I'm overwhelmed and beyond grateful. But this is just the beginning. That’s why I’m asking you to give me the name of the most beautiful songs to you. I’ve posted the question on reddit and will listen to the top 30 upvotes and then post my top 5 from that batch.

You know that awkward moment when you and a stranger are walking towards each other but need to get past each other and you get confused and end up doing a left to right dance? Not for me! When I walk through large crowds of people, to avoid walking into anyone, I simply stare at my destination. I look no one in the eyes. People actually will watch your eyes and they avoid the direction you are going. If I look into people's eyes as we are walking into each other, we are sure to collide. You have to let people know where you intend to go with your eyes. It always works for me, try it! Your turn, teach me some good mind tricks! *Edit- Wow I didn't know there were that many "mind tricks"! Thanks Redditors for your knowledge and wisdom! *Edit-Thank you masterthenight for the comment: "To add onto the OP comment, simply turning your head to indicate which direction you are going works as well." *Edit- One of the best responses I've heard comes from WhatAppearsToBeADuck: Tell any male adolescent that you think their voice is high. Their voice will immediately drop on their response. *Edit- another good comment from dmalfoy123: When you're driving, stare at the back of someone's head or their rear-view mirror and focus all your energy. They will eventually change lanes.
In what was posted on r/cyberlaws a few hours ago, it seems there is going to be a legal battle between Conde Nast and Warner Bross. I think the community has grown pass being a property of anyone, and I think a lot of us were unaware of this "User Agreement" between us the users and this company named Reddit. I love Reddit dearly with all my heart, it has brought a lot of happiness to a lot of users, some of that was thanks to the fact that people did not need to worry about copyrights, and I hate to see it crumble to become a patent/copyright troll on the back of its users. I'm not sure how it should be done legally, but I think that paragraph has no place in such place as Reddit, and I as a user will definitely change my behaviour on reddit as a result of finding out about it. Lost all control over the incoming messages and comments. I apologize if I'm not answering - feel free to send direct message on specific questions. alienth responded that they checking into this, and my comment with a couple of questions got downvoted and disappeared, so here are the questions I'm still hoping to get answers to: Can you give us more details? Can you in the meanwhile remove that pargraph? When is it going to be actually changed? Are we going to be allowed to comment on the new user agreement before it is imposed on the community?

Mine is when I went to the Oatmeal homepage and right clicked and did view page source. (OK SO JUST SAYING MY FRIEND TOLD ME TO DO THIS I TECHNICALLY DIDN'T FIND IT BUT I REALIZED THERE WAS A COMIC) [This came up.] (http://imgur.com/i2CvS) Then I saw that in the words by the PTERODACTYL's mouth it said HTTP://PTERODACTYL.ME so I went there and well [this] (http://theoatmeal.com/comics/ptero) is what it brought me to. I was impressed. [EDIT] OK so i wasnt sure if the http address would work so I added the other one they are the same. Just chill about it. [EDIT] WOW!! I never expected this to become soooo big thank you all! Even getting close to the front page is amazing! Again THANK YOU ALL!! [EDIT] Again how did this get so much upvotes. I am surprised. It is the end of my first month of Reddit and I like to think I am doing pretty well..... [EDIT] Nobody is here anymore but someone just commented about a couple days ago. I thought this was archived. I love cats. Cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat. rape. Dead people. Pigeon. I hope someone sees this. And my penis. I have a girlfriend. Gay faggot shit chips. I'm not crazy..
My story: When I was 13 a doctor wrote me an adult dose for a certain medicine based on my weight. I was a fat kid. Our body does not work that way and the medicine ended up constipating me...for a month. I did not shit for a whole month. I got sick. I had racoon-like eyes, my stomach would jump or flutter by itself, I had cramps, etc. It was bad. I was miserable. I finally told my parents how long it had been since i had shit and they freaked out and took me to the hospital. There, they gave 3 enemas back to back. After the third and final one, all that water softened all that shit up just enough i could expel it. I ran to the nearest bathroom, gown open in the back, and tried to make it to the toilet. I didn't My ass was hovering at a 45 degree angle above the toilet when the geyser burst. This next part is not a lie, but i know some of you will think it is, I got shit everywhere. On the ceiling (somehow), on the floor, the toilet was covered, the walls, even the sink got hit with some spray. Shit was literally, yes literally, sprayed on all walls and ceiling. It was everywhere. I felt like a new kid after that. Cleaned myself up the best i could and then had to figure out what to do. There was no way i could clean it all up, I needed a janitor. So I walked out and politely told a nurse the bathroom need a clean up and badly.
Link to original So, amazingly, crustlessmist and jwild98 determined the correct license and created a damning visual aid to show it within hours of my original submission. I gave the information to the police, who took over a week to respond to me, but said that they located the owner of that license and served papers to them. Meanwhile, I had given the same information to my insurance provider: Geico. They ended up telling me that the other party was also insured with Geico and had submitted a claim just after the accident happened, claiming that they were involved in a hit and run(!). I asked and the agent told me that they claimed the car was parked and unoccupied when it was hit. The other agent got a recorded statement from me over the phone, which was extremely formal. She was all business until she asked if she could stop recording and I said yes, after which she said, "Woooooow. I haven't had one like this in a long time!" After some talking and investigation by Geico, they determined that I was the innocent party and I finally got a car rental from them (after a month of sharing a van with my wife and three kids, which is a pain when you need to get to work early). They didn't want to give me the rental earlier because they didn't know whether MY uninsured motorist insurance should pay for it or if we would find the other party and make their insurance pay for it. Geico found out that the insured person's son had been driving that night and decided to lie about the accident when they got home. I still figure he must have been doing something illegal at the time since he had insurance and still didn't stop. I don't know, though. The police never told me his name and haven't contact me further regarding the issue. Yesterday, they finally inspected and estimated the repairs my car would need. Today, they told me that they were declaring it a total loss and they will give me $2,800 (and change) for my 2000 Buick LeSabre Ltd. I'm not a car guy, but I remember him saying something along the lines of the "rails" being warped and the quarterpanels being bowed out and some other things. They were just looking at body damage and it was over the value of the car (it's not counting the mechanical damage that was done). I have until Friday to determine if I want to accept the offer for the title. Geico also said they would pay for my medical bills, but it's a one time payment after treatment is ended. I have to give them HIPAA permission to get my bills from my medical providers and they will pay them. They also mentioned something about "mental anguish" and "suffering" but never mentioned a number. I guess a month without my normal convenient mode of travel and initially not being able to walk without immense pain after the accident count as anguish and suffering... so how much is that worth? I can't really think of an amount that I'd be happy to take if it were going to happen to me again. So one day I'm sitting at a red light, minding my own business and a month and a half later I've lost my primary vehicle for an amount of money that can't cover a comparable vehicle. Still, it was exciting to hunt down the offender and at least get him to be held accountable for his prevarications and douchebaggery. Thank you for all of the help, reddit! Edit: saw the wall of text after I submitted and determined I should add a tl;dr TL;DR: Cops found ass who hit me and ran. Geico also found him. Ass had claimed hit-and-run on his own vehicle. Geico determined I was right and he was wrong. Geico says it will pay for my medical bills. Geico totals my car and offers me $2,800 (I have until Friday to accept). I now have no car. Edit: It is amazingly difficult to keep up with the waves of people crashing into this thread. I just want people to know that I'm doing my best to read the comments, even if I'm not responding to all of them. And I'm totally getting the feeling that I need to speak to a lawyer. :) Thank you. Edit: Wow! The number 1 spot on the front page! And I didn't even misspell anything in the title or make any glaring grammatical errors! To think I was just sitting here tonight browsing reddit and kind of half-assedly thought, "I guess after today I have enough to give them a decent update... yeah, ok, I'll write it out." I should have taken a picture of my empty driveway and posted it and then I could have reaped all of this sweet karma. Edit: I just looked up the guy's name in the court website and found out that he's got a hearing coming up on the 14th. He was charged with "Failure to Stop / Accident - MISD" and the code section is here. It says that it should be a Class 5 Felony. This page says that a class 5 felony is punishable by a jail term of 1 to 10 years, or up to a year in jail and/or up to $2,500 in fines. The court website lists that as the code section, but it also lists the type of case as a Class 1 Misdemeanor. I should call and tell them my car just got totaled.
Shortly after my mom died, I was drunk as hell at a bar in my hometown (which was a frequent occurrence in those days). I was having a rough night, so I went outside to sit on the curb and have a cigarette. This older gentleman, probably around 60-65 sat down next to me because he said I reminded him of his daughter and he wanted to help me feel better if he could. I talked to this guy for a good hour, about my mom, about my life, about dropping out of college and basically losing control of everything because I couldn't deal with her passing. He gave me some of the best advice I've ever received and made me feel like things could really be okay again, eventually. He waited there with me until the bar closed and my friends found me. I gave him a huge hug and tried to thank him as genuinely as I could. I never saw him again and I have no way of finding him, but I think about him all the time and how much of an impact a total stranger had on my life. Edit: the advice he gave me is further down this thread, sorry!
Edit: Wow! I wasn't expecting so many awesome ideas. Keep them coming! In a couple hours we'll be going shopping to pick up everything we need for a day of science. Edit 2: You guys are amazing. I'm still reading through all the suggestions, but these are the ones we'll definitely be doing: Corn starch & water Volcano Mentos + Diet Coke, followed by soda bottle vortex Pepper in a bowl of water Moebius strip Penny and nickel battery Egg in a bottle Soap, milk and food coloring Crushed soda can Film canister rocket Liquid with layered colors Cork rocket Frozen bubbles Supercooled water Clouds in a bottle Update: I smell like vinegar and have food coloring all over my hands, but we had a ton of fun. We didn't quite get to everything this afternoon, but now we have supplies for another time. All told, we had to buy about $20 worth of stuff at the grocery store -- there's no way you'll have this much fun with less money! And he learned a lot, too (especially about pressure, which was probably just because it's easiest for me to explain). Thanks so much for everyone who contributed ideas. I'll be visiting this post over and over again to find other fun ideas for future lazy Saturdays:)
I used to work at Claires and The Icing (same company). We got about 15 minutes of training before we were allowed to pierce kids' ears. If people bled on the ear piercing guns, we would simply wipe them off with a tissue, and use them again on the next person. We were also never taught anything about cross-contamination and blood borne pathogens during training. I would never take my kids to get their ears pierced at the mall. Choose a reputable body piercer and take your kids there. Some people are afraid of taking their kids to body piercers because they look sketchier than the pretty mall down the street, but body piercers will use an autoclave and most of them (if they're any good) are trained to properly deal with blood and bodily fluids. The person at the mall, no matter how much experience they say they have, does not have the proper tools to deal with blood. About 99% of our piercings did not draw blood, but the 1% that do are definitely not dealt with well. I tried my best when I worked there, but there's only so much you can do when there is no equipment on hand to properly sterilize anything.
Just trying to gauge interest for a website concept EDIT: Okay, looks like I'm gonna go for it. Anyone with any sort of website building experience is welcome to give me advice :) EDIT 2: poorstudentscookbook.com is up and running! I'm gonna be working hard throughout the night to figure out how to actually run a website. Recipes and shit will be posted shortly. Thanks for all the interest! EDIT 3: First Recipe is up! Let me know what you guys think! I will accept all criticism. EDIT 4: Yes, I know the website is ugly right now. I promise to make it pretty in the near future, as soon as I start figuring out website development haha EDIT 5: The website is going to be free. I don't know why people think I'm making you pay for the recipes. I'll have ads but that's about it. And there will be a vegetarian section. It's not all going to come together instantly, but I can assure you that by the time school starts (September 1st for me) I will have a fully-functioning website. EDIT 6: A lot of you are messaging me with ideas for my website, and I just want you all to know that while I may not be able to reply to everyone, I'm going to try my best to take any and all suggestions into account. The response I've gotten has been awesome. I promise not to disappoint my fellow redditors!
I'm talking weird occurrences, coincidences you haven't been able to easily explain. I'll start. We have a breakfast laid on at work every morning, just a simple buffet of eggs, bacon what have you. Nothing huge and it's really only to feed about a dozen people or so. I am usually one of the first guys from my team to get to work and the kitchen was deserted as usual. I walked into the little kitchen, there was a ceramic egg tray thing with 12 eggs in it, like the bottom half of an egg carton with a socket for each egg. All spaces are filled with warm freshly boiled eggs. I take one, walk over to the garbage bin, shuck the shell then I walk back over to the food and stop dead. There are 12 eggs in the tray again. No one entered the room while I was peeling the thing. I touched the mystery egg it was the same temp as the other eggs around it. Not a big thing, nothing major, but something very strange. Given one does not get presented with strange eggs from a parallel universe every day I peeled and ate that one too. TL:DR - Found strange quantum egg at breakfast. Ate it. Did not gain super powers. EDIT Holy crap. You magnificent bastards, we're on the front page! Your stories are wonderful, uplifting and truly freaky in equal measure. But it's nice to know other people notice shit like this too. Redditor Wanhope was kind enough to start a subreddit for this topic so feel free to drop in and share your experiences!
This will probably get buried .. When I was around 20, a few years ago, I kept having dreams about a woman with long black hair named Aroura [ pronounced A-roar-uh) . They were different dreams but for some reason, her distinct face and name always ended up in them. It got to the point where I would wake up frustrated and confused, trying to google her name or find out how I was connected to her. After a few months she stopped showing up and I dismissed it, thinking my brain was just being a "scumbag." Fast forward a few years later, Halloween 2009, I'm in the car with a friend stopped at a gas station. I'm about to pull out and merge onto a highway when I get a phone call from a random number, so I stop the car but no one answered. There was a person behind me who grew impatient, honked at me, and then swerved in front of me instead of waiting for 2 seconds for me to move. Second they get on the highway, some silver civic loses control of their wheel and crashes into the car that swerved in front of me. I called the cops and waited at the gas station for them to come. Turns out the drivers of both cars died. It 100% would of been me if I hadn't of got that phone call. Called it back a few hours later out of gratitude and curiosity, rang 3 times and went to voicemail. "Hi, you've reached aurora, please leave your name and number." Never had goosebumps like that in me life.
got the idea from this: http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/c7osn/so_i_rented_a_movie_out_of_one_of_those_redboxdvd/c0qoplp. Post your codes and I'll add them to the list! cheat list: Stop: Stop: Play. Skip advertisements in movies and go strait to the movie. Dial 0 during most automatic menu phone systems to be taken to operator to route your call. also, mashing buttons may work as well. Whenever you have a voice automated phone system, typically saying "representative" gets you someone right away. Update In regards to Cheat Code # 2 I recommend this site: http://gethuman.com/ keep a spare car key in your wallet/purse. If you have a bulky Key that won't fit in your wallet, get a key made that doesn't have the electronic chip on it. It will still unlock the car, it just won't start it. changed by popular request Risk Update: if your wallet is stolen they have your car key. All they need to do is go to your house some time later and take your car out of your driveway. Riding a bicycle will save you lots of money on gas, parking, medical bills, and gym memberships. If you are speeding and suddenly up ahead see a cop that clearly just tagged you, slow down and wave to him/her. Your odds of being pulled over are quite a bit reduced. Don't be rude, but NEVER answer any cops questions when they call you in for questioning. when getting lectured into voice mail, hit 1, pause momentarily. If you aren't put through immediately, hit *, pause. Finally, hit # if neither 1 or * worked. It is called the 1-star-pound technique, and it works for all cell carriers. If your credit card magnetic stripe starts to get worn from use and being in your wallet, and doesn't always read in the card reader, you can use the plastic bag trick. Put the card in a plastic grocery bag and then swipe it. Not sure why it works, but it does.Taking it further though, you can simply apply a piece of quality cellophane tape over the mag stripe for a "permanent" plastic bag trick. At the end of your shower turn the water really (or all the way) cold. This will wake you up and get blood flowing. Update update 9: It also closes your pores to allow for less dirt and bacteria to get in to help reduce acne problems. Macy's credit cards usually have a 20% discount on purchases. I pay with the Macy's card, then while still at the register, I immediately pay off the charge with my debit card. I just got 20% off my purchase and I never get a credit card bill. - this also works with JCP and kohl's cards. im replacing the free movie rental cheat because its unpopular...mostly with movie rental clerks :-/ heres a new one! When you buy something online, you usually get a chance to enter a promo code before you purchase. Google the promo codes. They're out there - you can get anything from free shipping to 25% off the purchase. Turn it off, then on again. Buy things out of season, this can save you money. Unless its food, then buy it in season. When you have forgotten someones name, simply say : "I'm sorry, but what was your name one more time." They may act offended, but when they give you there first name you simply reply "No, I meant your last name." (more socially acceptable to forget). Bingo. First and last names. When eating buffalo wings, the flat portions. You can detach the smaller bone on one end very easily, then twist it a bit and it will just slide out. You're now left with a big hunk of meat and only 1 bone, you can just bite it off into your mouth in one piece, flintstones-style. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRcOY-PvOC8 Gently work an orange in your hands to loosen the peel from the fruit.

If you get a ticket on the windshield of your car, you can potentially get away with parking illegally in the same lot for the rest of the day by keeping the ticket on your windshield. edited reduced from a few days for a single day. Most tinfoil and saran wrap boxes have little push-in tabs on the sides. If you push them in, the roll won't fall out when you try to rip out a sheet of it. Keep a list of all of the credit card phone numbers (1-800) in your cell phone. This way, if your wallet is ever lost, you can call them immediately to have them disabled. It's also a good idea to place all of the cards in your wallet on a copier and print a page to keep at home. This will give you access to your License #, etc. Update: You should update 20. If you lose your wallet.. as in misplace it.. put a hold on your credit cards. Do NOT cancel. If you cancel it can later show up on your credit report. If you believe you are going to find it later, placing a hold saves you the red mark on your report. If you are driving an unfamiliar car and you don't know which side the gas tank is on, just look at the little pump icon next to the gas gauge on the dashboard. The pump handle on the icon will be on the side of the tank. Update: saw the gas tank one on an older reddit, turns out the handle thing is not consistant. But there IS usually a little arrow next to the icon. Second Update 99% of the time the gas door is opposite of the tailpipe. So far, I have only found that early-mid 2000 Pontiac Vibes break this trend. Third update if there is no arrow, then it most likely is on the passenger's side. I've yet to see one without an arrow that wasn't on the passenger's side this tip was unpopular, so im changing it This one changed my life. If you're at home/work/party or GOD forbid your girlfriend's house and the toilet starts to overflow, take the lid off the back reservoir part and lift the long handle as far up as it will go. The water will stop rising and then you can quietly mutter curses at it till it goes back down (which it does, more often than not...) link to a Diagram: http://superhomeideas.com/images/toilet.gif to peel a boiled egg, roll it around on your plate for a while until all of the eggshell is cracked evenly. Then it's easy to remove the complete shell at once. After you boil eggs immediately place them in ice cold water for a few minutes. No vinegar or salt or oil or whatever people use. Shells slip right off you spill any liquid that will stain on your carpet (red wine, juice, etc), pour some salt on it. Work it into the carpet - just rub it in with your hands. Leave it there for a few hours (for serious stains, up to a day) and vacuum it out. Voila, stain gone. If you park in a large parking garage/shopping centre, get out and take a photo on your cell phone of the nearest parking sign (Area B2, etc). You will never lose your car again. If you drive stick and the battery s dead, get some friends, put the key to the on position, put the car in 2nd and push the clutch down. have your friends push your car. when you get a decent speed going let the clutch up.

The fine for this offense (at the university I worked at) was $250, and usually a ban from parking at the university (i.e., booted or towed on sight). College Parking Cheat Code: Anyone who's gone to a college or university knows they usually charge a ridiculous amount of money for parking (usually $300+ for a semester pass or $10+ for the daily passes), a service that should fucking be free for students considering the high cost of education. Fuck them. Buy one daily pass at the beginning of the school year (usually a small paper ticket printed out a machine on the lot), take it home and scan it, photoshop the date for tomorrow, and print. Repeat for the next 4 years. Anyone with even the most rudimentary photoshop skills can pull this off convincingly. Even if your printer is shitty, from behind the tint and glare of a car windshield, it might as well be a 7-11 receipt.

5 min ago my reddit all turned spanish....all the tabs, preferences..etc. I went into preferences and made sure they were checked to english....they were....what is going on? I cant read spanish so I am in need of some help here....i am asking you b/c I cannot find the mod help link b/c I cannot read it. UPDATE- ok- it must have something to do with firefox. And to all of you telling me how to change lang. preference, OF COURSE I TRIED THAT before I posted. On IE all is normal. On my desktop all is normal. On my netbook, using firefox, it is a taco show. I ran the page through google translator and I especially enjoy the rick roll. So anyone know how to un-spanish reddit in firefox? This is the only page it is happening on. EDIT- I must admit this is hilarious. I wish i had paid more attention in spanish class.... UPDATE- So I wake up this morning to about 1500 replies in my inbox that I cannot read. And then I run them through Google translator and most of them say stuff like "the dog is in my pants" and "where is the library". Thanks, reddit. As far as the Spanish problem goes.. I disabled all my firefox extensions, cleared all my cookies and restarted it all again. THE SPANISH IS GONE! I do not know what possessed my computer to run for the border, but I am glad it is back. :)
Obtener una buena cantidad de mantequilla de maní en un cuchillo o una cuchara (esta cantidad varía en función de sus preferencias personales) y se distribuyen de manera uniforme en uno o dos rebanadas de pan para que el pan no se empapada por la jalea.

So I was in a coffee shop this morning studying for a midterm. At one point I look up from my table and I see a twenty dollar bill laying at the feet of an attractive blonde making an order. I assumed it was hers since her wallet was open, so I walked over, picked it up and gave it to her. She took a look in her wallet and had all her money accounted for, so she told me it wasn't hers and said something along the lines of 'finders keepers'. So without thinking I handed the twenty to the cashier to pay for her order and walked back to my table. A few moments later, the blonde walked over to thank me and give me the change. I said "I know that normally guys are supposed to introduce themselves first and then take a girl out for coffee, but since I did this all backwards, how would you like to sit down and give me a chance to introduce myself?" She sat down. We talked. I got her phone number AND a date this weekend. In no way could I have scripted it any better. So Reddit, what is the smoothest thing you or someone else has done or said that ended in a date? EDIT: I scored a date AND the front page! Today was a good day!
ALRIGHT ALRIGHT WE'LL DO IN AMA NEXT MONDAY STARTING AT 10AM PST Thank you everyone for the awesome response. Our traffic just shot up 350% and it's still going up. Sorry about not responding enough, we got entirely overwhelmed by the comments and discussion. There were many serious questions and we think we can try to answer them better in r/IAmA. See you then! I'm one of the founders of Microryza, we're basically like, crushing it. I'm just kidding. Science crowdfunding is hard. But we love what we're doing so much that we dropped out of grad school to spend the past year doing nothing but coding and talking to scientists. We think it's important because when were working in labs, all these brilliant scientists and professors never spent their time in their lab doing research and spent all their time writing grant proposals. We decided that science isn't supposed to work like this. A recent survey by NIH saw that the average PI spends 12 weeks/year writing grant proposals. I wrote a blog post about this and some of the other problems that young scientists face in academia:
A friend of mine had his backpack with his $1400 engineering laptop in it, stolen, while at the campus food court. I had a weird gut feeling it would turn up on Craigslist, or somewhere similar. Everyday for a week I checked Craigslist. Exactly one week later, I found the laptop. This EXTREMELY stupid criminal took a picture of the laptop screen WITH MY FRIEND'S LOGIN NAME. Yeah, very stupid criminal. So I contacted the seller immediately via email and he responded within 20 minutes. I said I'd like to buy the laptop from him. We agreed to meet at a near by parking lot later that day. Next, we called the cops. They agreed to set up a sting on the theif. One of the officers pretended to be a buyer, and approached the thief. The officer acted as if he was examining the laptop, but was actually looking for the serial number. BOOM, it had a matching serial number and they arrested this dumbshit. A week ago (Four months later) the guy was proven guilty, and to my knowledge, is spending a year in prison. Plus, my buddy finally got his laptop back!
When I worked at Hollywood video (before that evil corporation went out of business) a man came into my store and bought one bag of popcorn. When I opened the register he pulled a box cutter out of his pocket and told me to give him all the money. My first reaction was to laugh. I couldn't believe I was being robbed. He then waved the box cutter around and swore he wasn't horsing around to which I told him he wasn't getting anything. He said he'd cut me and I told him good luck climbing over the counter to get me. He then placed his hands on the counter and leaned towards me. I grabbed a box cutter of my own and said look at that, a Mexican stand off. Now here is where it gets silly. The man asked if I was threatening him. I said no sir, still laughing at the situation. He then proclaimed he was calling the police and I said please do. He did and he WAITED for the police to arrive! He told them I brandished a box cutter and threatened his life. I then showed the fine officer our security footage and wouldn't you know it? He arrested my new friend. That's my favorite work story, call it bullshit if you want. So, any great stupid "criminal" stories?

She was telling me about it today and i couldn't think about anything except how horrible high school people can be. So here's the story. This guy set up a facebook event for this party at this big hall and over 120 people RSVP'd. 700+ invited. So it's not like no one knew about it. Considering the amount of people that would know about it and come, even if they hadn't clicked attending, was that high this guy booked a massive hall that could cater for such a large event. This cost him around $1500 which included food, security etc. Then he decided instead of using an iPod, which would probably get lost/stolen on the night, he'd hire a DJ. That cost $400. All of this the host had spent months working his ass off so he was able to actually afford it and hold the 'best party ever!' Come the night of the party, weeks of preperation money and organisation, this party is expected to go off! My sister heads off to this massive venue, 'fashionably late' aswell, and no one else is there. Much to their surprise, It's just an empty hall with lights going on and a DJ doing his thing. Then she finds the host and asks the normal questions; 'where is everyone' etc. He is as baffled as my sister was. Not even his best mates had shown up which was even more surprising. Now this is just the most gut-wrenching part of this whole thing. The host then calls his friends. He asks them 'where the hell are you guys?!' and, obviously on loudspeaker an uproar of laughter comes from the person speaking and you can also hear it in the background. He starts crying and everything, absolutely devastated about what has happened. Not only is he out of pocket at $1900 least and knowing that all your friends possibly organised a boycott for this event . When I was told this story i couldn't stomach how harsh and horrible people can be. I never even though this happened, especially on such a large scale as this. TL;DR Host works for months to be able to afford expenses for a party which was expected to have over 120 people in attendance. No one actually attended except for my sister, her friends, the host, his parents and girlfriend. When he called his mates to see when they'd come, they, as well as many other people in the background, just laughed at him and hung up
Bought a penis-ring to have sex with my ex-GF. The first (and only) time I used it, I set the ring size way too small - basically choked my penis from lack of circulating blood. Completed sex, but the next morning my penis was shriveled (like half its normal flaccid size)and looked like it was covered in really tiny veins everywhere. Went to the ER and it turns out that I caused ischemia in parts of my penis, burst a few blood vessels, and basically destroyed my ability to get an erection for the rest of my life. I am only in my 20's. Edit: I didn’t expect this comment to blow up so much, thank you all for your empathy (and TY for the reddit gold). There are a lot of questions below. This happened three years ago, and my ex broke up with me shortly afterwards. I can still get a semi-erection, maybe 20% of what it was previously if I use viagra. It gets engorged somewhat, but doesn't get 'up' like previously. ED causes a lot of stress, anxiety, worry, etc. no matter what age you are. The worst part was that I really couldn’t confide in anybody what was the source of my stress… my parents especially could see something was wrong whenever I visited, but I just told them that I was upset because my girlfriend broke up with me.
From mtv.com "A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion. "Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle. "Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, 'I'm going to beat the sh-- out of you when we get home! You wait and see!' " The detective said "Robyn F." then used her cell phone to call her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales, who did not answer. "Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, 'I'm on my way home. Make sure the police are there when I get there.'
EDIT 10: Replaced pie charts with columns showing the top percentages EDIT 9: We are back up! Thanks to Ed at Zymic for all the help! EDIT 8: Working with Zymic to get the site back up Last week I setup a survey on a "free" survey account. It was "free" until I tried to retrieve the results. So I promised to make a new one. Here it is. I've been on reddit for a while, and I really enjoy the community. I always wondered who the people of reddit are. So I make a quick survey to find out. This is not a scam. Every single question is optional, you don't have to answer a single question if you don't want to. It's 100% anonymous, I don't ask you a single question about your name or account. You can look through my reddit profile and see that I've been here for a while, and am not just a bot trying to steal data. If you have any questions or suggestions let me know. If you think of any new questions I can add them easily. Now, here's the best part....INSTANT RESULTS!!!! I've created a real-time results page.. That's updated every time someone takes the survey! EDIT: Please upvote if you take the survey, so that others can see it. Thanks! EDIT 2: I am aware that Atheism and Agnostic are not Religions, but there that was the best place to put them. EDIT 3: Results require flash! EDIT 4: Only two people have reported finding the easter egg.....c'mon guys! EDIT 5: Shutting Down Temporarily for troll cleanup EDIT 6: The site has crashed, since it's hosted by some other company, I'm having trouble restoring it. I'll be working on it and get it up as soon as I can, ok it's up, but still being trolled.
My mom is a trucker, this is her story. She was driving through Arizona when she saw what she thought was leaves blowing across the road in the distance. This puzzled her since there's mostly pine trees in northern Arizona. When she finally got to the "leaves" she realized that they were migrating tarantulas, 1000's of them. There were so many of them that her truck was sliding on their guts so she had to slow down. She stopped at the first truck stop and told her co-driver to fuel up (he was sleeping at the time) because she wasn't going to step foot outside after what she just saw. Her co-driver was pissed since it was technically his time off, and he thought she was crazy, until he saw the tarantula guts and legs caked in the inside wheel well of the truck. She also outran a tornado in the midwest. She was about to pull over and take cover until she saw another big rig that was parked on the side of the road get tossed a couple hundred yards like a toy. She called me and told me that she thought she was going to die and wanted her last words to be "I love you" to me. She pulled off the freeway and got to a Wal-Mart, where she ran into the basement where all the staff and customers were taking shelter. After the tornado passed, they stepped out of the basement and into daylight, since the Wal Mart was destroyed.
Where's my Droid. As much as I use some of the other apps (especially the flashlight), I always seem to lose my damn phone in a couch, or god knows where...and it is ALWAYS on vibrate when it happens. So, you text a preselected word or phrase to your phone from a friends phone or what have you, and it automatically turns on the ringer to max volume, and plays until you find it...once you find it, you just hit the found phone button, and the app closes and your ringer settings return to what they were previously. Good stuff. Edit: I use the free version. Obviously the paid version is better (WMD also has the ability to take pictures with front and rear cameras, remotely activate gps, do a remote wipe, can use camera flash to help find it, can white/black list numbers, has a passcode that you can set to keep people from changing your keywords, sim card options, etc. some 'advanced' features are only available in the paid version...and YES there ARE versions of this type of app for the iPhone, but I don't know the names or quality.)
I work from a home office, and this time of year is really slow for my company. Of course, I need to stay close to my computer to respond to emails and calls, but I'd like to find something to do with my time. So Reddit: What can I do with my time at home? I'm a 23 year old American guy who is fairly well rounded (skill and knowledge wise) so you may suggest some things I already know or do, but I'd like any input you guys can get me! I'll update the post as responses roll in. Edit: (8:16 Central Time) Still buried in mail. you guys are awesome. Again- thanks, and keep 'em coming! I'm starting work on a (highly abridged) list, but as several folks have linked, there are many similar lists on reddit and elsewhere.

No judgement, I'm just here to listen. Edit: Wow guys, it's been a journey. It's 1 AM and I have to be up for work tomorrow. I just want to say how happy I am that you all shared this with me. I'll respond to a few more, then I'll be up and back at it tomorrow. Peace <3 Edit2: I lied about going to sleep. I stayed up longer and read more of your guy's comments. It's actually very moving that you'd share all of this with me and I truly thank you. Unfortunately, I have so many comments that I honestly can't keep up with them all. A lot of them have to do with the same issue, so I strongly suggest you read through the thread and connect with some people that are going through the same thing. I'll do my best to comment on a few more, and I PROMISE to read every single last one of your comments. Even if I don't respond, I want you to know that I did/will read it. Goodnight folks. <3 Edit3: Edit2 bothers me. I want to reply to everything. Some of you deserve recognition and I feel like just reading them isn't enough. I see your problems, and I empathize deeply, I just can't reply to every single one. I'm sorry guys. :( Edit4: THANK YOU to those of you out there who are also replying to people! I noticed some comments I was reading already had some replies. You people are saints. :) Edit5: Follow-up. I'm still responding to some of the comments that are coming in, but I also wanted to mention that a fellow Redditor has made and invited me to moderate r/whatsbotheringyou If you would like, we can respond to some of your problems that you submit there in the form of a text-post. Cheers. <3
Hired full time, and I make a good living. My work involves a lot of "data entry", verification, blah blah. I am a programmer at heart and figured out how to make a script do all my work for me. Between co workers, they have a 90% accuracy rating and 60-100 transactions a day completed. I have 99,6% accuracy and over 1.000 records a day. No one knows I do this because everyone's monthly accuracy and transaction count are tallied at the end of the month, which is how we earn our bonus. The scum part is, I get 85-95% of the entire bonus pool, which is a HUGE some of money. Most people are fine with their bonuses because they don't even know how much they would bonus regularly. I'm guessing they get €100-200 bonus a month. They would get a lot more if I didnt bot. So reddit, am I a scumbag? I work about 8 hours a week doing real work, the rest is spent playing games on my phone or reading reddit... Edit: A lot of people are posting that I'm asking for a pat on the back... Nope, I'm asking for the moral delima if my ~90% bonus share is unethical for me to take... Edit2: This post has kept me up all night... hah. So many comments guys! you all are crazy :P
This one really gets me. I had a best friend that died of a heroin overdose last year, and the last time I saw her, I was being irresponsible and skipped out on work so I could hang out with her for the night. We were having fun and drank a little bit at the end of the night, ended up taking some group pictures with us and another friend. Those are the only pictures I have of her with me. I had no idea that that was the last time I was ever going to see her and I got to see her that one last time and by some random stroke of luck, get the only pictures I have of us together because I chose to be irresponsible and say fuck work for that day. I have never been happier to make a "bad" decision than I have been for that, fuck I'd skip work all year if I could see her again. She overdosed about 2 months later, out of nowhere. I found out from the messages on Facebook and it felt like my stomach just disappeared, like I suddenly became empty inside. Life has never been so horrifyingly real and I still get panic attacks sometimes when I think about her, but god damn am I happy I got those pictures from that last time we ever saw each other.
When I was in grade 12 English class we had been reading Death of a Salesman. It was the first class of the day and the Teacher was late. It was odd, but no biggie, so the class just bullshitted to pass the time. Five minutes pass, then ten, when I finally spoke up "Hey, HEY! We should just keep reading from where we left off yesterday guys." I was a very charismatic kid. Probably the most agreeable guy in school, the friends with everyone type, so everyone actually went along with it. It's a play, so everyone who had a 'role' the day before just resumed it and we kept reading. Well, 5-10 minutes later the Vice Principal comes in. He was obviously surprised that we were doing work, but he didn't mention it. He just told us our teacher was dealing with a personal issue and she would be a little while longer. 10-20 minutes more passed and she finally showed up. When she opened the door and saw us there, all reading and paying attention, she burst right into tears of happiness. She died a couple years later from Cancer, way too young. She was only 40. Around the time of her death I found out that was the day she was got her diagnosis/prognosis. So on one of the worst days of her life, our class helped make it just a little better. So, reddit, let's hear your stories.
My friend and I were pulling onto the highway yesterday when suddenly a Mexican looking kid waived us down and ran up to our window. He was carrying a suit case, the big ones like we take on international vacations and it seemed as if he had been walking for a some time. Judging from his appearance I figured he was prob 20-21 years old. He asked us if he could get a ride to "Grayhun". We both looked at each other and understood that he was saying Greyhound, and the only Greyhound bus stop in town was at this gas station a few miles down the road. It was cold and windy out and we had some spare time so we told him to jump in. Initially thoughts run through your head and you wonder... I wonder whats in that suitcase...is he going to put a knife to my neck from behind the seat... kilos of coke from Mexico because this is South Texas?... a chopped up body?...but as we began to drive I saw the sigh of relief through the rear view mirror and realized this kid is just happy for a ride. When we got to the gas station, my friend walked in and double checked everything to make sure it was the right spot but to our surprise the final bus for Houston left for the day. The next bus at 6:00 p.m. was in a town 25 miles over. We tried explaining this to him, I should have payed more attention in the Spanish I and II they forced us to take in High School. The only words I can really say are si and comprende. My friend and I said fuck it lets drop him off, and turned to him and said " listen we are going to eat first making hand gestures showing spoons entering mouth and we will drop you off after" but homeboy was still clueless and kept nodding. We already ordered Chinese food and began driving in that direction and when we got there, he got out of the car and went to the trunk as if the Chinese Restaurant was the bus stop. We tell him to come in and eat something first, leave the suitcase in the car. He is still clueless. When we go in, our food was already ready. We decided to eat there so he could eat as well. When the hostess came over, she looked spanish so I asked her I was like hey listen we picked this guy up from the street, he missed his bus and the next one is 25 miles over can you tell him that after we are done eating we will drop him off its ok no problems... and she was kinda taken by it and laughed, translated it to the guy, and for the next 10 mins all he kept saying was thank you. After we jumped into the car, I turned to him in the back and was like listen its 25 miles, I'm rolling a spliff, do you smoke? He still had no clue, but when we sparked it up, and passed it his way he smoked it like a champ. He had very broken English, but said he was from Ecuador and he was in America looking for a job to make money for his family back home. Like I said he was prob 20-21 years old. Shorly after, we arrived at our destination, and said farewell. Dropped him off at some store where he would have to sit on a bench outside for the next hour.. but I did my best. I hope he made it to wherever he had to go. My man got picked up, fed sweet and sour chicken, smoked a spliff and got a ride to a location 30 mins away. I hope he will do the same for someone else one day.
I've picked up numerous hitchikers but one in particular stands out. His name was Garth. Garth was a hell of dude with a hell of a story. This is the encounter between my friends and Garth. After graduating high school, myself and 4 friends decided to take a long road trip over the summer and Glacier National Park was our Mecca for the trip. We found ourselves camping in the middle of nowhere in the woods of NW Montana, some 25 miles north of Missoula. We camped illegally and got drunk and stoned and pretty much stayed up all night. In the morning, I woke up in the drivers seat of my car to see some dude walking by in the road which was 40 yards away from our campsite. The guy walking couldn't see us just passing by but I could see him. I was still half drunk so I decided to yell at him, not even thinking that it could be the owner of the land that we were illegally camping on. He did a 180 and stared straight at me and began walking towards me. He had a single backpack, a big tree limb for a walking stick and looked exhausted and hungry. He looked like the Big Lebowski mixed with Saul from Pineapple Express but acted like someone who had just had their ass kicked, mentally and physically. He looked like someone had suck his soul out of him. My friends had heard me yelling for him so they had stirred awake to find to their surprise, Garth sitting in one of our lawnchairs eating our stale Doritos like he hadn't eaten anything in days. We would later learn that was actually true.
I admit I had one when he asked me. Back when I was about 13 or 14 my cousin and I were walking out of a restaurant in central Washington. It was late in the evening and already dark. There was a very large river nearby us and I saw a light in the sky that appeared to follow low above the it. Now there was a small airport across the river so I gave it not another thought to being anything other than a plane. But instead of turning left to the airport it suddenly increased in speed and appeared to shoot upwards and quickly across the town. Then it flew off to the right towards a smaller town about 10 miles away. It then stopped and hovered above it for just a few seconds before a smaller light came up from the ground, appeared to hit the first light, and then both zoomed away in the distance. I turned to my cousin and he just looked at me and asked "did you see that too?" To this day is it the only thing I have seen in my life I can not explain. What about the rest of you? What is your weirdest unexplained event in life? EDIT: Well I have learned two things from this. The first was that the guy was right about a lot people having one weird story. The other is that I really should not have tried to read all these replies before bed because now life is terrifying. Some of you have apparently seem some scary shit.
This one isn't quite "supernatural" but it was weird. I live in a very homogenous area. I know everyone on my street and almost everyone in my neighborhood. Everybody is white middle-class. I had recently got a cat, who I loved, but was an idiot of an animal. One day she ran up tree with absolutely no branches and just sat at the top. Would not come down. I live next to a contractor who had helped get her down from another tree, but said he couldn't do anything this time. The tree was too thin and, like I said, no branches until the very top. If I had to estimate I'd say the cat was 20-25ft high. I was pretty upset. I sat there waiting for her until about 2am and then I just had to go home and I passed out on the couch. At 4am I hear really loud knocking on my door. I open it to see a man fully decked out in camo-gear, including light face-paint. He was holding my cat. Here's the conversation we had, almost verbatim. In a thick Russian accent he asks, "is dis yours?!" "How the hell did you get her down?!" "I climb." "That tree had no branches!"
In terms of loopholes, my criminal law professor was also a practicing criminal defense barrister, and he told this story about a case he had won: The event happened in the city of Jervis Bay in Australia, which is notable because it's an annexed part of federal land so that our capital territory can have an active port. My professor's client had gotten into a fight on the beach and, in knee deep water, proceeded to beat the shit out of the guy he was fighting. Assault charges were laid and it went to court. My professor managed to find that, at the time, the delineation of the federal land around Jervis bay ended at the high water mark. Also, at that time, the delineation of the coastal region belonging to the state ended at the low water mark. He managed to show that, because the crime had happened in between these two points, neither the state or federal court had jurisdiction to try the client, and he got off. Obviously the definitions were amended after that so that there would not be such a gap, but that one guy got through.
My favourite are the exploits of Corporal Leo Major, a Canadian scout/sniper in WWII and the Korean War. Highlights (in order of occurrence) Single-handedly captures a German Half-Track vehicle on D-Day. Vehicle turns out to contain important communication gear and code books. Comes across an SS patrol, kills all four, looses an eye in the process, refuses discharge for the injury. Single-handedly takes 93 prisoners at the Battle of the Scheldt. He was offered a DCM for the action but turned it down (wasn't a fan of current leadership). Single-handedly liberates the city of Zwolle. Major and his friend were sent in to recce the town prior to an artillery barrage and assault to come in the morning. After his friend was killed by machine gun fire, Major killed the gunners, took their weapons and entered the city. Over the course of the night, Major killed and captured so many german soldiers, and kicked up such a racket that the german garrison thought they were under attack by a far superior force. By morning, the German Army had retreated from the city. He received his first DCM for the action.
Here is an album of some pictures taken the night it happened and pictures taken this morning in the daylight. The officers tried figuring it out, but none of their guesses brought back any drivers. I live in Virginia, but this happened in a small city that has a university with ~13,000 resident students, so the license could be from any state (or even Canada, I suppose). I have liability insurance on this vehicle. Geico told me that if they can't cover me that I can at least get coverage through the Virginia Uninsured Motorist fund (or something to that effect). My concern is that my back is very screwed up from this (it was a massive jolt). I've had moderate trouble walking, sitting, and moving today because of the pain. My car also started cutting off while driving to where I suddenly lose power steering, breaking, acceleration, etc while driving. Shifting into neutral and starting the engine fixes it for a while, but I only did that enough to get home. TL;DR: Got rear-ended while stopped at a red light and the guy drove off. My car is broken and my back is pretzeled and my only hope to find this hit-and-run class act is to decipher the license plate smudge he left on my bumper. Please help! EDIT 1: Remember that the imprint is backwards from what the license actually says. EDIT 2: The Virginia DMV has an app for trying out different license plate messages, if it helps. It seems to tell you if a license number is available, too. Edit 3: Thank you, to whomever gave me a month of Reddit Gold! Edit 4: Oh, my goodness. I just crawled out of bed and saw that the comment count has risen from 53 to 975! Time to start reading! Thanks, everyone, for looking! Edit 5: crustlessmist figured out the plate number and jwild98 made a convincing graphic showing how that plate number matches up with the impression on my bumper! Following that amazing stuff, the following unexciting update: I attempted to leave a voicemail for the officer on my case, but the voicemail system was not letting me in for some reason, so I called non-emergency and talked to an officer there who offered to give the officer a message for me. I'm going to try later today to call again. With this being a smaller city and it being the weekend, I'm thinking I might not have luck until Monday, but I'll keep trying. Edit 6: No updates from anyone yet. I figured I'd go ahead and put the part number from the pieces I found on the ground here. One of them says: 52127-06050 ITW ^UP TSOP-1G >PP+E/P-T15< R TOYOTA and the other one says ^UP 52128-06050 TSOP-1G >PP+E/P-T15< TOYOTA The "ITW" on the top one looks funny... like it was scratched in by hand. I'm trying to get a picture up, but imgur is having problems. Here is a picture... had trouble focusing with the cellphone. Edit 7: Update: The officer on the case called me and I gave him the information that I've gotten here. He told me that he is actually off this weekend, so he's going to run the tag information on Monday and see if he finds anything. So, I guess I'll have to wait until Monday to learn anything new. I did give the same information to my insurance company, so maybe they'll get back sooner? I don't know. Edit 8: Update: The officer on the case works nights, I believe (I was hit at night), so I don't think he's going to run the plate number until tonight sometime. My insurance company wanted to wait until today to see what the police came up with (although I've let them know about all of the work you guys did, too). I haven't heard anything today. The officer said he would try the plate number and see if anything came back. Obviously, we all know something's going to come back because the report someone ran came back with a VIN number, and I've had some anonymous reports PM'ed to me that point that license back to a town that is only 8 miles away from here, so I'm confident that 5MRTNS is the guy. Now I just need to keep the officers and insurance agents on it. I'll report back once something more significant happens. Edit 9: Didn't hear back from anyone Tuesday. Wanted to give the officer a chance to call me (I believe he works nights) and wanted Geico to get a chance to do their own thing and call me back. I called Geico and the office on my case today around 11am. Left a message with the officer telling him that I'm following up on the lookup he said he was doing, because there's a felon out there and I've been going to the doctor and my car doesn't work, so I'd like to get insurance rolling. I'm going to call again later this afternoon. I think I need to be annoying. Edit 10: I've been calling. Haven't gotten a call back from the police yet, and I can't get the officer on the phone to speak with (only voicemail). Geico let me know that they got the guy's address from the plate number and sent him a letter telling him to contact them. I told them, "He's the offender in a hit and run. What makes you think he'll call you?" My case worker is currently trying to get permission to run a report cross referencing their entire database to see if the guy has been involved in other claims and who his insurance provider is. I feel like they're probably doing what they can. I just left another voicemail for the officer and told him that Geico was able to get the guy's address from their database, so I would assume that he should have been able to as well and to please contact me to let me know what's going on (and gave him 3 different phone numbers he could reach me at). I'm going to keep calling and am considering the current advice of getting the local news involved. Edit 11: I left a voicemail a few days ago with the Investigations Office informing them that I was not getting any calls back from the officer on my case and could someone please let me know what's going on. That night, a Sergeant called me at home and told me he would be leaving messages with the officer and the officer's training officer, letting them know that I need to be contacted. This morning, I finally got a call from the officer, letting me know that they found an address for the plate, but haven't been able to contact the person yet. He said he's hoping to be able to charge the person by this afternoon and that he'll let me know either this evening or tomorrow. Possibly humorous sidenote: He started his message to me (I was at work and he called my house, yay online voicemail) with: "I just wanted to shoot you a message..." the first part of which caught me off guard. :-P Edit 12: The officer called my house again a few minutes ago. He said he served papers to the guy and (according to my wife) said that "the individual" seemed like he was just going to plead guilty and get it handled (of course, speaking to a lawyer may change his mind). The officer said that I probably wouldn't be needed in court unless the guy went for a trial, in which case I'd be subpoenaed, but for now my insurance company should have enough to be able to pursue the guy's insurance. All in all it feels rather anti-climactic.
Hypothetical scenario: An anonymous billionaire is privately funding this. You will never meet them. They are not filming or recording any aspect of this; they simply enjoy knowing they have this kind of power. Each day you are woken up by a man peeing on you. This man has been hired by the billionaire to pee on you. They are regularly checked by doctors to make sure they are healthy and infection-free. Regardless, urine is sterile. Stinky, but harmless. As soon as the pee hits your face (and oh yes, he'll aim for the face) you can jump out of bed and go to the shower. While you are showering the man who pees on you will switch your mattress, put on new sheets and leave $300 in cash on your dining room table. The above situation will happen every single day for the rest of your life until one evening you decide you do not want to be peed on the next morning and cancel. Then it can never start again. Ever. A few conditions: -You may have as much or as little interaction with the man who pees as you want -The man who pees will act as an alarm clock/wake-up call. You can tell him to begin peeing at 6:30am and that's exactly when he will start. -If you share the bed with someone he will be aiming for you. Spashback onto the sleeping partner is a possibility. -If you go on vacation he travels as well. He will typically stay in the hotel room next to yours. The question is: How long would you let this go on? edit: Apparently R.Kelly likes to pee on people edit: To address a common question: Barring a once-in-a-lifetime emergency("My water broke!"), you must be peed on in the morning. This means if you wake up a few moments before your alarm was to go off you must lay there until the first drop of piss hits you. You can have a conversation with the man who pees if you like. Or simply maintain the world's most awkward eye-contact. edit: For any Jack Bauer's out there: Even if you do not have a regular sleeping schedule you must choose a time in a 24 hour period to lay down in bed and allow pee to hit your face.
EDIT: OBLIGATORY WOOOHOOOOOO FRONT PAGE!! Thanks for sharing your stories, and for the kind words as well. I'm not even exaggerating when I say this makes up for my shitty evening with Mr. Revolutionary Lifestyle. So now I just popped open a beer for all of you wonderful people and going through the comments.. I feel almost lucky! Fucking hell, some people are awful!! Hope you've all had better luck since then.. As for myself, I just chalked it up as a lesson.. part of my 'screening' for dating now would include asking the guy if he's into health supplements haha! Really, thanks to all of you.. last night roughly at this time I was moping around after getting home from that 'date'. Now I have countless hilarious stories to read through while drinking and kind messages from you awesome bunch.. worth it! Story-time (warning: wall of text) So I've known this guy for almost a year now, not really good friends or anything, more of casual acquaintances (we have a bunch of common friends and see each other from time to time, parties etc). A couple of months ago he started messaging me, first on Facebook, then by text (he got my number from a friend, he didn't ask me for it) and most of the time I responded just to be polite. He's nice enough, but not really my type.. so when he started dropping hints about 'meeting up', I just turned him down and said I'm busy, or we'd just catch up the next time there's a gathering with our friends, that sort of thing.. Fast-forward to last week and he asked me out again, which IIRC is the 6th time in the past 2 months. I finally decided to at least give him a chance, cos hey what could go wrong anyway, and who knows what I'm missing and all that jazz.. Worst-case scenario it would be awkward, but we've talked more than a few times so I was thinking it can't be that bad and we could actually have a pleasant time. Date night comes and we meet up in the city after work. We have dinner; nice, cutesy Japanese place.. conversation was okay.. I was certain at this point that it's really not going to take off, he really isn't my type.. but I was having a pleasant enough time and he was a total gentleman and not bad to talk to. The bill comes, and I was going to suggest a quick coffee before heading home. However, he said that there's something he'd made an appointment for us for and we need to rush off to make it in time. I was a bit intrigued and excited; was it a movie, or a show, a play (he knows I'm into theater)? So we hurry off and he took me to a high-end luxury mall with an attached wing for offices.. we went up.. wait, this is an office lobby.. what the.. It was a fucking weight-loss center. So he explains that he's part of this company (he works for them on a part-time basis as a distributor) and he wanted to introduce me to their products which would 'revolutionize' my lifestyle and make the healthier I've ever been in my entire life. (FYI I'm 5'5" and 135lbs). I was totally stunned at this point so I was just nodding like an idiot the whole time we were walking inside. He then left me with his smarmy 'teammates', who proceeded to give me an orientation about their company and a run-through of their health supplements (when he got to the part where the weight-loss products are, the smarmiest one said, "Oooh now this is what you've been waiting for, I saved the best for last!") I just sat through it because I knew that if I started to say something, I was definitely going to burst and make a spectacle of myself (there was a seminar ongoing and we were at a little table to the side). After I flat-out said that I'm not interested in any of the products and frankly don't believe that I need health supplements (I eat well and exercise regularly), they started on the 2nd phase: introducing me to the 'business' aspect of it. Basically, it was a networking model of business where you not only sell the products, you also recruit people to sell them and they would be under your 'team', and you get a commission for every sale they make. They rhapsodized about the wonders of the product, how easy it is to sell, and how much money I could be making because they could tell I have the right kind of 'personality' and 'network' for it. Registration was 'only' $1,000, and it was consumable in products.. which I could either use or sell to get my registration money back immediately. I wish I could say I flipped the fucking table and screamed at them to fuck themselves with their health supplements and hope they overdose on their products, but no.. right after the 'talk' I just said I should head home since it was getting a bit late. The guy actually messaged me to say that he had a good time and he hopes to see me again.. and that I would reconsider their products and the 'business opportunity'. I called some friends up and went out for drinks because fuck your health supplements that's why TL;DR Went on a date, guy brought me to weight-loss seminar, tried to sell me $1,000 worth of weight-loss products, and then tried to recruit me to join their networking business.
menthol cross-reacts with and decreases the stimulus threshold for cold-sensitive thermoreceptors. Edit: So some people wanted more information ELI5: menthol is a chemical in mint flavored chewing gum, this chemical is able to activate nerves that normally respond to cold temperatures <20C. That is why when you first chew gum it "feels" cold. They also make those cold sensors more sensitive so now they will start shooting signals to your brain when you drink water even though it isn't <20C; however, your brain only knows that these neurons are saying something is cold in your mouth and that's how it becomes interpreted. Something similar happens when you eat spicy food and it feels "hot" (or if you get pepper sprayed); but in that instance a different chemical called capsaicin interacts with heat sensors. AskScience explanation: Menthol and capsaicin activate different receptors. Specifically, menthol can activate TRPM8 receptor, which is normally activated at temperatures < 20C. Capsaicin, on the other hand, activates the which is normally activated by temperatures > 43C.

This question actually came to me from Mass Effect (can't remember which game in the series, might've been 3). There some dialogue about how universal policy didn't matter as much to humans because of their significantly shorter lifespans compared to other races (I am probably misquoting, but I believe that was the general sentiment). This got me thinking about the following questions: If the average human lifespan was significantly longer (e.g. 200+ years), would our morals, philosophies, choices be different? What kind of effects would it have on our governments, economies, or religions? I guess two different ways one can approach these questions: If humankind had evolved to such a long lifespan thousands to millions of years ago. If in the next decade, significant technology allowed for humans to live much longer. Thoughts? Comments? Edit 1: A good point was made on how the body should age along with the increased lifespan. For the sake of the post, let's assume it's relative. So for example, the amount you would age in one year currently would take three years instead. Of course this is just one viewpoint. This is definitely an open-ended question and am curious what other Redditor's thoughts are. Edit 2: Guys, I go to happy hour and I find myself on front page? I'm not drunk enough to comprehend this! The discussion has been awesome so far and I guess I'm not sleeping tonight because I want to read as many responses as possible! Keep the discussion going!
Just as the title says, I need to do a survey for class. The largest sample size along with proof gets to skip midterms. It can be brand or flavor, I'll sort them out later. Mine is Ben and Jerry's Chocolate Macadamia Nut Edit: The reason I didn't do survey monkey is because we're not allowed to. She however did say I could use social media and other online resources. Edit 2: Holy fuck on a stick. I honestly only expected about 200 replies. There's no way anyone has more than 3000 for a sample size. It'll be a pain in the butt to sort this out. Thankyou for the penis and skunk flavors as well. Don't stop, keep them coming just for curiosity's sake. Edit 3: Oh my god, 14,000 replies I can't thank you enough. Good news: I have the largest sample size and I have bragging rights for the whole semester. Bad news: It's going to be a pain in the butt to sort through all of this and make sense of it. Also my professor said future classes cannot use Facebook, Twitter or Reddit for any future surveys. I've ruined it for all. Last Edit: This is awesome I'm going to have to hire a couple people to read this through. Also if anyone is still reading, I_am_not_a_novelty also has a similar survey. Go ahead and fill that out for them as well http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/KQ9PCPS. There's also now a subreddit dedicated to surveys r/SampleSize. Ask away
I posted this here originally and then this update back in October. Summary: I innocently stumbled across naked pictures of my little sister on the Internet. From advice I received here on Reddit I confronted her about them. I found out after spying on her that the issue was much larger than it first seemed. She ended being put into a mental hospital because of me and I hated myself for that. Okay, so my little sister ("Julie") was in the hospital for almost two months. During that time she refused to see me. My mom, my dad, even two uncles and one aunt? She saw them at visits. But she refused to see me. I was convinced the entire time that the reason she didn't want to see me was that she hated me. I must have re-read my second post about this a hundred times, just to re-enforce my belief that I had done the right thing by telling our dad about the situation. Believe me, the comments in that second post really did sustain me. I've never loved Reddit so much as I have during some of the worst sleepless nights I've gone through, nights where I felt like the shittiest brother ever. Reading your assurances that I had done the right thing really helped me get along through this very difficult time. We were told two weeks ago that she was scheduled to be released on the 21st of December. This had nothing to do with money or insurance (my parents were paying out of pocket for her stay there but cost was never an issue). Apparently she has adjusted well to her new medications and is in much better, more sober state of mind now. I was thrilled to learn she'd be home for Christmas. I dreaded seeing her only because I have not seen her since the "intervention" that led to her being hospitalized in the first place. I was so worried she hated me that I even told my mom, upon hearing the news of her release, that I would gladly crash at my friend's house for a while. My mom's response? "Are you crazy? She wants you to be the one to pick her up!" ... Sorry, I still get teary-eyed when I remember that. So it turns out that the reason my sister didn't want to see me that entire time (two months!) was that she was embarrassed. She didn't mind seeing our parents or our uncles and aunt but she just couldn't handle seeing me. She felt like she'd let me down or something. I drove nearly 2.5 hours out to the hospital last Monday (only the second time I'd ever been there), alone, and greeted her in the reception area. She literally ran over and jumped into my arms when she saw me. I cried like a baby, Reddit, and I'm not embarrassed to admit as much. We talked a ton during the drive home. She has a much firmer grasp on her condition, now, then she did before. Best of all, and Reddit was right about this, she does not hate me for "turning her in". She's healthy. She's safe. She's on medications to deal with her Bipolar disorder. And she actually thanked me for intervening before she did something stupid, like meeting up with that one guy (aka "Asshole"). I worried so much, for so long, for nothing. My little sister still loves me. And I did do the right thing. Thank you, Reddit, for all of your thoughts and comments during this time. I've been feeling miserable for so long, because of all this, but your thoughtful comments and suggestions helped me from going into despair. This is why I love this site. Thank you again. /edit A few things. First, to all of you well-wishers, thank you so much for the kind words and good wishes. They mean so much to me you have no idea. Second, to the anti-meds crowd? Get a job. Sure, meds are sometimes over-prescribed. I won't argue that. But my sister didn't have an "episode" or a "temper tantrum" that was misdiagnosed as Bipolar Type I Disorder. While I'm sure that happens sometimes, you are in absolutely no position to gauge what my sister was going through. You don't know her, but I do, and trust me the girl who was posting those long, crazy messages on those image boards? The girl who confronted me and threatened me with all kinds of crazy nonsense the day after I talked to her? The girl, in short, who was off her medications? That was not my sister. That was my sister in a manic episode. If you have to ask the what the difference is between a manic episode and typical teenage angst/temper, you've never seen one. I hope you never have to, too, because they are scary. Scary scary. Sorry, I didn't mean to go on a tirade about that. It's just... frustrating to read some of the holier-than-thou, "you do realize Bipolar is the ADD of the 2000's, right?" type of messages this post has garnered. So fucking annoying. Go give L. Ron Hubbard some money but STFU on this post, please. Again I'm sorry. The vast majority of the responses here have been so supportive and uplifting, but the few trolls who managed to get a bunch of upmods for being contrarian did sort of piss me off. Done being angry, Reddit. Oh, as for her long term care? She's going to be in IOP (Intensive Out Patient) for the foreseeable future. That means, starting in January, daily visits to a local clinic where she'll receive both group and individual therapy. She's also going to see the psychiatrist she took a huge liking to at the hospital once a month until she finds a new doctor to replace her. She's fine with all this, and is actually excited about it. She has this journal she keeps showing me that she writes in when she starts to feel "unbalanced". She says it's like her own private "group therapy" but she can't wait to be in the real thing again. Our dad took away her computer but he set it up in the living room, right next to the television set, and she's free to use it whenever she wants. She has absolutely no privacy on it but she seems to be okay with that. I think the biggest test will be when she goes back to school. She lost an entire semester because of her hospitalization and she'll be needing to go to summer school to make up for it and while she says she's fine with that, I know it sort of bums her out. Plus, school is usually a "trigger" (so I've noticed) for her bad depressive and manic periods. But I really believe she's ready this time. I've never seen her so strong and resolved to handle her condition as she appears right now. Well, that's it. This is most likely the last ever thing I type using this account. As I mentioned in my original post, I have a real Reddit account that I often use and I simply created this one for this particular issue. I am very glad that I did, too. Reddit came through for me in a big way. I hope that others out there who are in any kind of strange/heart-breaking/etc. type of situation look to this experience and find inspiration to share their own story, whatever it is. The trolls and the assholes try to grind us down but Reddit is good at fighting back. I so fucking love this place. I love you all... yes, even the trolls and the assholes. Adieu, adieu from blind-with-worry. edit the last Okay forgot to mention... as to the Asshole: Believe me, like most of you, I want to go after this prick. I really do. I actually had a huge argument with my father about this about a month ago. When I calmed down, though, I realized that the legal advice he was getting was correct: fanning flames risks spreading fire. What my sister needs now, what our family needs now, is time to heal. Would it feel good to crush that motherfucker? Sure. Would it draw everything out, though? Definitely. That would not be a good thing. Sometimes what feels good is actually bad or at the very least can make a situation worse than it already is. Let me put it like this. Say I posted his Gmail username here. And Reddit went to town crushing him in all sorts of ways. So he decides, "Heck, that bitch ratted on me. I'll show her!" and he ends up reposting the obviously self-shot images to every site and image-board, maybe even here on Reddit. Not only would that humiliate her but it might have legal ramifications for her. What's done is done. Trust me, I know it's a bitter pill to swallow. I'd like nothing better than to meet this asshole someday and do things to him that would get me 20-life in a state prison. But when you think on it logically, what good does that do for my sister? For myself? For my family? As tempting as it is to send his wife an anonymous letter, too, there's just one problem... I don't have his address. In short, I'm just going to have to leave my revenge fantasies to my imagination and Tarantino movies. This asshole/douchebag will likely slit his own throat one of these days anyway. In the meantime, no fanning the flames. Doing so spreads fires. and those are the final words, I swear this time, of blind-with-worry
This is embarrassing and not really recent, but in high school I thought people were saying "heart on" to mean they liked something (like affection comes from the heart). The day I found out people were actually saying "hard on" and it meant an erection was the day I realized I had been telling everyone including adults and teachers that I had an erection for everything. Also adding to my embarrassment is that I'm female. Edit: How I found out that I was mistakenly saying "heart on" to mean "really like": One of my older brother's friends had mentioned that our school really liked 'Brad' because he was a good student. So that evening at the dinner table (with my brother's friend present), I told everybody that the friend said "the school has a heart on for Brad." Everybody got really quiet and glared at my brother's friend. I was very confused and then instantly mortified when my brother explained everything to me after dinner. Also, one very vivid cringe moment I have was telling a room full of people that "I had a heart on for peppermint ice cream."
The barista at my local Starbucks didn't tell me until I handed him my card to pay for the car behind me that 8 of us had done the exact same thing. He and the other workers could not stop smiling! All of them seemed really excited about what they just witnessed, and honestly--I was really stunned that 8 of us had independently decided to pay for the car behind us. After the madness that was Black Friday, and the horrible behavior that usually accompanies it, I just couldn't help but be amazed at what I had inadvertently been a part of. I've paid for people's meals/groceries/coffee before (especially around the holidays), but I've never been on the receiving end of a "pay it forward" chain or somebody that helped keep one going! I know the 8 of us didn't solve any major world crisis this morning or really help anyone out, and the woman behind me may not have actually liked having her drinks purchased by me--but the semi-anonymous gesture of buying your neighbor's coffee on a cold Sunday morning just...moved me. I just couldn't stop smiling. It was as if kindness was contagious this morning! :D And just thinking about a possible "pandemic" of kindness leaves me breathless. I'm sure this isn't even the most impressive "pay it forward" scenario that people have encountered, so I want to hear your tales! Maybe some of us have all been a part of the same chain of kindness. :) Edit: So far it looks like drive-thru cafes and tollbooths are common places for this type of masked-goodwill! haha Though I'm really impressed with how u/Drunkdillweed may have started a pay-it-foward chain at a Little Caesars. Edit 2: Alright, coffee is definitely the current leader in the "thing to anonymously pay for" category haha. I have included a semi-visual explanation of how this can happen in a drive-thru in a later edit bellow! Edit 3.5: (I've added some NEW stories at the end of the list!) While I'm in love with all the coffee stories, here are some hidden gems in case you miss them! Love flows as much as the liquor in this bar tab story; Paying-it-Foward can happen in courthouses too! A little kindness can lead to some judicial magic; kindness is extra sweet in this twist on providing random holiday desserts; apparently car washes are a fantastic place to get a kidness-cycle going; coupons may be good for redeeming a bit of kindness as well; depositing some quarters in a meter may be a great way to drive away some stress in another commuter's day; a toy store worker saw multi-generational magic when humility was anonymously rewarded; book-lover left a prepaid gift card at a register so that the clerk could reward a family that was supportive of a child reading (link coming); and some non-drama filled popcorn is gifted (though not accepted) to a couple of movie-goers. I still really love that idea though!; several "clean cycles" of kindness are being spotted in laundry rooms all over; and these folks caught the ever elusive "kind-crab" during their fishing trip. Most common drive-thru locations for kindness-chains: Starbucks, Tim Hortons, McDonalds, and Taco Bell. Edit 4: I just wanted to do a better explanation for how this entire thing occurred, for those of you who've never seen a drive thru cafe. So, in a typical American drive thru you will pull into a driveway that wraps around your favorite cafe/restaurant. Shortly after pulling into the driveway you will roll up to a giant menu with a microphone and this is where we place our orders. Then you pull up to the window to pay and pick up your beverage/treats. Once you or any other car pulls away from the giant menu, the barista/window worker has the orders totaled up. So, if you notice a long line of cars behind you and you'd like to do something nice for the person behind you, you can tell the worker that you'd like to buy the other driver's order too. No guess work is needed about the amount since it's already been totaled. Hope that clears some stuff up! Edit 5: While I'm still planning on updating the above list to help folks navigate around this incredible thread, this will likely be my last ramble. First, thank you for sharing your wonderful stories! I enjoyed reading all of them. :) Second, thank you to the anonymous gifters for the reddit gold! Now, I know several of you are still critical of this kind of behavior (and I definitely apologize if you've ever been a recipient of one of my errant coffeecup gifts!) and just don't get "the point" of all this. I think the biggest concern is that this type of act conflates helping people in need with giving a superfluous gift to someone who doesn't need it. I never wanted there to be a weighing of the two types of acts, especially since one is obviously more significant than the other, but I don't believe the latter is totally inconsequential... I mean, one can never be 100% sure that the person standing next to you isn't suffering somehow. That they aren't trying to cope with a terrible loss or struggling through a horrible bought of depression. But still, a coffee cup doesn't do any substantial good for those folks either, but it may just brighten their day a bit, which I think does everyone a bit of good. At the worst, it was a free annoyance. What ultimately makes this experience (and others like it) so beautiful for me, and why I think so many others love the concept, is that no one was harmed, nothing was solicited, and the only thing that connected a bunch of strangers for a brief moment in time, was a piece of shared kindness in the form of a cup of coffee. :) These moments are also poignant reminders of just how important it is to give to those who are struggling! If a pre-paid cup of coffee, toll charge, carwash, bar tab, or meal can make such an impact on so many of us, I can't imagine how life changing having someone providing for your actual needs can be. Thank you again for these wonderful stories, and I'll still try to add new/hidden ones to my list above. Take care Reddit!
I've been deaf since birth and there are lot of "sound words" that I read a lot but don't really know what they mean, and dictionary definitions often just refer to other sound words. It's never mattered to me before, but now I'm trying to write a novel with one hearing narrator and every time I use a sound word I'm not sure I'm using it right. I posted awhile ago to r/writing about "scream", "shout" and "yell" but I've generated a list of questions so I thought I should take it to a larger audience. People crying in sadness vs crying out in anger, I know there's some gray area in between where they can be used interchangeably, it's hard to get "shriek" and "ream" are both words that seem to imply emotion more than any specific sound. Is that right? Can any sound be described as "piercing" if it's loud and annoying? Like thunder for example. apparently people use "ejaculates" as a dialogue tag?!?! It seems to mean "to say suddenly or without warning" (or does it just mean "interrupt"?), but the more normal use of "ejaculates" doesn't imply that at all. I don't know if this is a deaf thing or maybe I'm just dense. Does sound have something to do with this? What does "jive" mean? Does "he speaks jive" and "he speaks AAVE" and "he speaks Ebonics" all refer to the same thing? I was raised by black parents but I can't understand any dialogue written in black dialect. I know not all black people talk like that but is there a way to mark that in a novel? Do you know of a webpage that would tell me how to translate dialogue into dialect like that? Are "stammer" and "stutter" synonymous? What about "chat"? Dictionary says "to speak informally" but I feel like it implies something I'm not getting. Is it speaking fast? Can you use "chat" as a dialogue tag? (like "What are you doing tonight?' he chatted"), I don't think I've seen it but the dictionary makes it sound like you can. "mumbling" sometimes implies apathy but other times hostility. Is that right? That's weird because it connotes opposites. What does it sound like? Is it synonymous with whispering? I know cats "meow", dogs "bark" and cows "moo" but what does these words mean when used in other contexts? Sometimes other animals are described with the same sounds, like I think foxes bark which makes sense because they're like dogs but I think I've heard dolphins described as barking too. That's weird. Does a dolphin and a dog really make the same sound? "howl" is just for animals except "howling in pain" right? Is a dog's howl just a long bark or does it sound different? Do different dogs sound different? What if they're the same size and breed? "Chirp" and "squawk" were originally animal noises but are now used in other contexts right? I don't know what they mean really. Birds and mice do them both interchangeably, that's as specific as I know. And I think bats chirp but never squawk? Is there a chart somewhere showing which animals make which sounds? Like, can a weasel growl? What about bears? Bears look like the kind of animal that should "growl" but I feel like I've never seen that written and Google doesn't show a lot of usage. Do all doors creak? Can all doors be slammed? Windows? Does "slam" always imply loudness? Do you always slam doors when you're mad? Do deaf people slam doors when they're mad? (I don't think so, but if it's just a function of being mad I might do it and not notice because I'm mad). People say "he slammed that beer" to mean chugged, that's silent right? Or does it mean "gurgle" in that sense? "Gurgle" is another hard one. And "gargle", that means something different right? "Ring", like "ringtone" is hard to get. What else "rings"? Cell phones sound different from landlines, right? People sometimes describe them as "chirping"? Dictionary says "click" is "A short, sharp sound as of a switch being operated or of two hard objects coming quickly into contact." but I feel like I've seen it in other uses, it's hard to remember exactly what I'm thinking of. But could I use it to describe cymbals, pennies or pencils hitting each other? If a voice is described as "tender", what does that mean? "moan" can be painful or sexy right? Anything else? Is it possible to moan joyously or humorously? "cooing" What is that? Is there a difference between a woman "moaning sexy" and "cooing sexy"? Apparently it's possible to "whisper" loudly and "shout" softly? WTF!? Thanks for answering any questions you can! Edit: Thanks, people are answering too quick for me to really read them all, I'm trying to answer questions though. I'll look over answers more thoroughly as I'm trying to write my book, I'll look at your responses to make sure I'm using my words right. So I may respond to you weeks or months from now.
I'm a TOEFL teacher, and so I actually have (some) training in making these sorts of abstract concepts approachable through simple explanations. I'll try: People crying in sadness vs crying out in anger, I know there's some gray area in between where they can be used interchangeably, it's hard to get People crying "sadness" is like looking at river rapids. It's a flow of emotion and grief. People crying out in anger is like a sheet of ice cracking apart suddenly. It's sharp and sudden. "shriek" and "[sc]ream" are both words that seem to imply emotion more than any specific sound. Is that right? Shriek is more painful (like a pin in your skin). Scream is more broad, like a scratch of a claw. Both imply the same general emotion of horror, usually sudden. Can any sound be described as "piercing" if it's loud and annoying? Like thunder for example. Thunder isn't piercing. Distant thunder is like a heavy blanket, or the feeling of a lead blanket when you get an x-ray -- if the thunder is very close it's like someone throwing a lead blanket on you and then punching you in the face. "Piercing" is like a fast thin dagger in your head or a dentist drill (it comes from "pierce" as in "pierce the skin")
our company had a corporate apartment we used mostly for out of town clients when they came in for meetings. i usually handled the maintenance of it: monitoring the cleaning service, setting up fresh flowers, fruit basket etc. for whenever it was going to be used. eventually i got promoted & assigned those duties to my new assistant. one day she called in sick, so when i found out a client was in town last minute i offered him the apartment for the night, and met him there to show him where everything was since he'd never stayed there before. imagine my (and his) surprise when i opened the front door to find my assistant and her boyfriend (?) engaging in a little friendly game of oral sex on the living room carpet. after i slammed the door shut and hurriedly got him in a cab to a hotel, i went back to work and listened to my voicemail. she had called to apologize for having lied about being sick. no apologies about the live sex show we'd just witnessed. just "sorry, i wasn't really sick, i just wanted a day off'. needless to say, that was the first of many days off for her.
My kids just found a little penguin on our beach! We have called the local environmental agencies, but they will only be here tomorrow. The poor little thing does not seem to be doing well. Is there anything we can do until tomorrow? The kids just named him Gunter :-) I am in the extreme south of the state of Bahia in Brazil. It is very rare to find penguins this up north, but this week alone, 3 washed up on the beaches. This is the first one that is alive. We are in a very small town, far away from any major cities, so there are no zoos or vets who can help around here. The people we called were not much help (it was the end of the day and the specialists were not in) but we were told that they will come by tomorrow. I would just like to know if any biologist here knew if there is anything we can do to help keep him comfortable (and alive) until tomorrow. Anything we can give it to eat? Where would he be most comfortable - in a cool place or not? He is not getting up, but he is moving a lot more now. EDIT 1 - Picture 1 and Picture 2. Yes, it is real Bath 1 and Bath 2. Video of Gunter when we found him EDIT 2 - Gunter made it through the night!!! He is resting in his towels, and was following me around curiously with his little head when I walked in to check on him. He is sooooooo cute!! We checked him for dehydration and to see if his temperature was ok (as per instruction of a biologist specialized in penguins) and he seemed just fine). He drank and also ate a little. I called the people who will come and pick him up, and the good news is that instead of keeping him the small center until they had more animals for the trip, they will try to drive him off today to the really big center 4 hours north!! I will take more pics before Gunter goes, and ask the people in the center to keep me updated. Thank you all for the help!!! EDIT 3 - Gunter does not seem to be doing well at all!! :-( :-( He is not responding to when we walk in, and when we touch him, he does not move his head much. He is sleeping and his eyes are closed, but he is breathing heavily. I think he is dying... :-( :-( ARGH!! And they called saying they won't be here until the afternoon. It will be too late!! I did not want him to die here :-( EDIT 4- Well, maybe he was just sleeping really deeply? Because he woke up and ate TWO live little fish!! He was not interested with the dead stuff yesterday, but he gobbled up the live fish! He also had water! I am afraid to hope, but how can I help it? Fight Gunter!! EDIT 5- They called again, and should be here soon. A picture of my youngest and Gunter and a picture of Gunter chilling Arrive already, Mrs. Biologist! UPDATE HERE
I take care of penguins and sea birds for a living. Give the penguin access to an area with a heat lamp. Keep quiet and leave it alone if you can. Purchase some local small bait fish, this is a juvenile but should be able to eat any small, raw bait fish that are not wider than the width of its neck. These penguins do well in warm climates, but access to COLD water (~40 degrees Farenheit) is good IF it is deep enough. If you don't have access to anything deeper than what the pictures show, don't worry about swimming him/her unless their feet get hot. If the penguin's feet are HOT, than he is overheating and needs cold water to lower his body temp. They should be warm, but not hot. If it will not eat, do not attempt to force feed him without knowing what you are doing. You could easily feed into their breathing tube if you are not trained. Best of luck. Don't get too attached. EDIT: 40 F should be the minimum temp, excellent for rapidly cooling an overheating penguin or alcid. Hopefully trained animal care workers have gotten to Gunter by now (8/15/12)!
