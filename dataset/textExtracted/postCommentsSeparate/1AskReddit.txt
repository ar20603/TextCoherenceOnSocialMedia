I pay with the Macy's card, then while still at the register, I immediately pay off the charge with my debit card. I just got 20% off my purchase and I never get a credit card bill. - this also works with JCP and kohl's cards. #11 Permalink When you buy something online, you usually get a chance to enter a promo code before you purchase.

The pump handle on the icon will be on the side of the tank. Update: saw the gas tank one on an older reddit, turns out the handle thing is not consistant. But there IS usually a little arrow next to the icon. Second Update 99% of the time the gas door is opposite of the tailpipe. So far, I have only found that early-mid 2000 Pontiac Vibes break this trend. Third update if there is no arrow, then it most likely is on the passenger's side. I've yet to see one without an arrow that wasn't on the passenger's side #22 Permalink this tip was unpopular, so im changing it This one changed my life.

Shells slip right off #24 Permalink you spill any liquid that will stain on your carpet (red wine, juice, etc), pour some salt on it. Work it into the carpet - just rub it in with your hands.

The fine for this offense (at the university I worked at) was $250, and usually a ban from parking at the university (i.e., booted or towed on sight). College Parking Cheat Code: Anyone who's gone to a college or university knows they usually charge a ridiculous amount of money for parking (usually $300+ for a semester pass or $10+ for the daily passes), a service that should fucking be free for students considering the high cost of education. Fuck them. Buy one daily pass at the beginning of the school year (usually a small paper ticket printed out a machine on the lot), take it home and scan it, photoshop the date for tomorrow, and print. Repeat for the next 4 years. Anyone with even the most rudimentary photoshop skills can pull this off convincingly. Even if your printer is shitty, from behind the tint and glare of a car windshield, it might as well be a 7-11 receipt. I did this for 2 years at a UC and saved hundreds of dollars. The new list of real-life cheat codes based on the top scoring comments from both the new list created by MrCassiBro and the old list Number Cheat #31 Permalink When you go to a restaurant where they bring you your drink in a cup/glass, ask for no ice or for ice on the side. Often what they do is load your drink with ice so that it seems as if there's more in there, especially at bars. #32 Permalink When you pour soda, pour it along the side of the cup instead of directly into it - like they do at bars. This keeps alot of the "fizzyness" in the drink and as a result, it keeps a lot of the texture and flavor. #33 Permalink If you need to withdraw more money than your limit, if you do it quickly enough, you can withdraw your limit twice from the same ATM and sometimes the one next to it before it stops you from withdrawing any more. #34 Permalink If you back up the toilet at work or someones house with no plunger available, look for liquid hand soap. Dump some in the toilet and wait about five minutes and flush again. The soap lubricates the nasties so they'll flush away. If its still clogged, find a way to dump hot water in the toilet, as it can have the same effect. Use the trash can or something. If its still clogged, kick the door open and run like hell. Find a new job or new friends. You just left their toilet full of hot soapy shit soup, you asshole. #35 Permalink When I am in a large shopping centre (mall) I take a photo of the information board on my phone so I can look up how to get to stores without having to go back to the board #36 Permalink When commenting on something, whether it be reddit, facebook, etc. finish typing your comment, stop, re-read it twice and then ask yourself what you are trying to accomplish with said comment before posting. #37 Permalink When you finish showering, use your hand as a squeegee(?) To get excess water off your body. It makes drying much faster and your towel will also be dry sooner. #38 Permalink Don't be a dick #39 Permalink if you gently rock back and forth while pooping it will take significantly less time and make it easier to pass more "troublesome" movements. Best. Lifehack. Ever. #40 Permalink Try and get in good with the clerks/secretaries of where ever you work or do business. Those are the people who can most easily cover your ass when you fuck up. #50 Permalink 1st Date Cheat Code for MEN: Never tell a girl where you’re going or how to dress. Instead, tell her to "dress for a first date with a guy she really likes". Now, pick three places you'd like to go: someplace fun and active (bowling, pool, mini golf, go-kart racing, ballgame, etc), something romantic and classy (nice restaurant, upscale lounge, art gallery opening) and something in between (nice bar, coffee shop, comedy club). Now, when you pick her up, let the way she's dressed decide which you’re going to do: If she's wearing something sexy and revealing (dress, high heels, low cut top, etc.) than she wants to go somewhere classy and romantic. If she's sporting some jeans, tennis shoes or flip-flops, and a tee, the bowling ally or pool hall may be a good bet. If she's wearing jeans, high heeled boots, and nice top or blouse, than she's not really jonesing for the super romance treatment, and she put in more effort than mini golf deserves (eighteen holes of mini golf in heels... seriously?), so a comedy club or some place with live music is a good choice. And never, EVER, do a movie on the first date! EDIT: Men: You're going to wear a pair of CLEAN, NEAT jeans, a pressed stylish LONG sleeve button down shirt, nice shoes or boots (try to avoid tennis shoes of sneakers). Works for ANY occasion! #51 Permalink If you don't know if a baby is a boy or a girl ask the baby "Whats your name?" And the parent will answer. That way no angry mom or dad getting mad because you cant tel because they dress there baby in green. #52 Permalink Wear a condom #53 Permalink On flights, if you are fighting for an arm rest with a stranger. bring your arm (the one thats on the same side the arm rest you want) up to your mouth and sneeze/cough. Then place it by the armrest. The other person will move their arm. Has had 100% success rate. #53 Permalink To stop a sneeze, tickle the roof of your mouth with your tongue. #55 Permalink Avoid forgetting something in the morning by placing it in your shoes. (works best if you wear the same pair every day.) #56 Permalink Give yourself half an hour of downtime in the morning, between being ready to leave and leaving, and your day won't feel so rushed. #57 Permalink Simply put: Don't ever overlay your reality onto someone else's reality. Example: Person A: "Oh man, I'm having a really hard time recently, I can't seem to get along with my mom." Person B: "Yeah, I know how that is, I just talked to my mom yesterday, and she was like...." etc. Let Person A reflect on their moment of hardship, stand back, listen, be there for them, but don't interject with your own thoughts/emotions about your own situation. #58 Permalink When you're talking to someone and can't tell if they are interested in the subject/their mind is elsewhere, cross your arms. If they cross theirs as well, they are truly listening. #59 Permalink Men of all shapes and sizes: Wear clothing that fits. Nothing looks trashier than a guy wearing a shirt two sizes too big or a pair of uncomfortable looking pants. This applies to fat guys too, don't try to hide your flub by wearing large t-shirts and jackets as they only make you look bigger! Instead get fitted and wear clothing that fits you. #60 Permalink Listen to music when doing stuff by yourself, it will make the most mundane task feel awesome. #61 Permalink If you want to get into a sold out concert simply go to the store and buy two bags of ice. Walk up to the front of the line and say, "I'm the ice guy". Free concert, minus the price of the ice. #62 Permalink If you are quitting something e.g. smoking, drinking etc. Everytime you feel the urge to do said addiction : Go for a run, do 20 sit ups, 20 push ups etc. This way you can start to associate exercise with quitting and you get fitter the more you quit which can make you feel better #63 Permalink Shut the fuck up. Wait for the lawyer. #64 Permalink No matter where you are in public, make it a habit of noting every reflective surface around you. Usually you can find one that gives a decent view of who is behind you. If you're at work, strategically place cds or other reflective objects so you can always see whose standing behind you in your cube. #65 Permalink ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A Start #66 Permalink Don't waste money buying expensive binoculars. Simply stand closer to the object you wish to view. #67 Permalink Before you take a dookie, throw in a piece or two of toilet paper in the toilet bowl to reduce/avoid splasing and that kerplunk noise. #68 Permalink Women can push the poop out with their fingers properly inserted into their vagina. #69 Permalink If you're shaving your balls, try to maintain an erection during the entire shave. The whole job is a lot easier with your penis out of the way. #70 Permalink If you have crushing chest pain, call 911 first. Then chew some aspirin. I work in cardiology. #71 Permalink When you eat hard shell taco's, do it over your nachos. That way when they disintegrate, you can eat the bits you lost with your nachos. #72 Permalink If you need to store cookies or pastries for a few days in a tupperware or other type of container, to prevent them from getting dry and brittle, put a piece of bread in the container right along with the cookies. It will keep them very soft and moist. Sometimes, if you burn the cookies a little and they seem very tough and crunchy, leaving them in a container with the bread over night will actually soften them up and make them better than when they came out of the oven! #73 Permalink Kill a boner within 30 seconds by squeezing your thighs together really tight. (Guys only). #74 Permalink Walk on the sides of stairs to avoid/reduce creaks. #75 Permalink Talk to everyone like you would your best mate, and smile. #76 Permalink Sprinkle some salt on your napkin coaster at the bar.. your beer won't stick to it EVERY FUGGIN TIME.... #77 Permalink To get through tech support quickly with an ISP, choose the option for becoming a new customer. Then when you get there ask to transfer to tech support. Usually they won't put you on hold because they see the number coming from the new customer line. #78 Permalink Pull on your hair in the shower, if it squeaks you already shampooed it. #79 Permalink Don't announce that you are having a kid till the second trimester. #80 Permalink When studying arts at university, take notes on your prof's political/philosophical ideologies and worldviews. Regurgitate in essays and on exams for an A grade. Also, margins, font, font size, etc. are incredibly important. Never neglect these. #81 Permalink Never include #41-#49 in a list of real-life cheat codes on reddit. Some things to remember: If you liked a tip, upvote its original author. It's only fair.

I like the one about the Rugrats. Ever wondered just how Angelica could talk to the babies? Angelica is the only one who can talk to the babies because they are a figment of her imagination. She is spoilt, sad and lonely, because her Mother is constantly working and has no time for her. Her relationship with her Dad is superficial and unsubstantial, no real love is ever shown to her. So how did it come about that Angelica would have to imagine these babies? Tommy died soon after child birth, a fact reflected by Stu never leaving the basement, inventing toys that his son will never play with. Chuckie died in the car crash along with his Mum, also reflected in the actions of his father; the crash has made him a pathetic nervous wreck most of the time. Most interesting is Phil and Lil. There never where any twins, there was just one baby. However this baby was a still born, and Angelica never knew the sex of the still born, so she invented twins of different genders. Sadly, Angelica never uses her imaginary friends to comfort or entertain her, instead she is mean and nasty to them. She has invented this relationship with these babies so she can vent her frustrations of being a spoilt, lonely brat who has seen much hardship from these unfortunate parents; frustrations that can't be satisfied by a typical childhood relationship with a doll, albeit a Cynthia one. EDIT: Wow. Went to bed and there was about 25 upvotes. Woke up and now there's quite a lot more, and a subreddit created! Great success! Will read them all, goosebumps will be had. And I know that the majority of these theories aren't water-tight (including mine...), but come on, it's fun to speculate! EDIT II: I have realized how my question could be interpreted the wrong way, hence numerous and humorous links to this. Indeed, my mind is blown. EDIT III: OK I'm heading off now, and by the time I get back this thread will have disappeared into the depths of Askreddit. Thanks for the amazing response! I know my theory was rubbish, but there are some absolutely amazing ones, my favorite being the Kill Bill one. Bill is not dead!. Don't forget to check out and post in /r/fantheories!
So a little of a personal story here. I happen to have a very common hispanic name, also I served in the Marines who on two different occasions lost personal information of mine to include my social security number. The state of Florida was able to pull $25K out of my personal bank account with only my very common last name and social. It was for someone trying to collect way past due child support. Neither Florida Child Support Collections or Bank of America bothered to check the first or middle name on the account. Much less the birthday, residence, or any other personal information. This all happened with out any notification. All the sudden I had nothing in my account, and it was up to me to figure out how to live for the next 3 months while BOA and Florida unfucked my shit. I realize its hard to pin down some of these worthless child support dodging assholes, but that does not mean that you can just remove funds from an account without matching every detail. Fortunately I have friends and family who helped me get a lawyer, and float me some money until all of this was figured out. However without them, I would have been up shit creek without a paddle. Sorry for the long story. Edit: Spelling
Obviously im going to use one. Back in highschool i dated a girl for 6 months before she decided it wasn't working out anymore and she cheated on me with about 6 guys and stole my iPhone and wallet to buy drugs. I wanted to report her to the police like my parents encouraged me to and to prevent me from doing such her brother jumped me while I was walking home with his friends and busted open my lip pretty badly and threatened to kill me if i reported him or his sister (this is South Florida, so i believed he would do it). My dad got a new job and we moved to a new city but i was still pissed about this whole situation so i did the next best thing. I created two fake facebook account of a random hot girl and guy, spent some time making it look legit with friends and such and added her brother on facebook with the girl and my ex with the guy. It wasnt too long before he started flirting "me" up and tried his best to get in this girls pants. on the other hand, having already courted my now ex i knew exactly what to say to charm her to the point that she was in love with me. This is where it all begins to get fun. I started a sexting relationship between the brother and sister with me as the intermediate thanks to google voice. Both of them had fairly typical south florida bodies so nothing really gave anything away and i did a fair amount of photoshopping to remove identifiers in the room that may give away anything. This went on for about a month and a half totaling about 200 or so nudes between the two of them when i decided to reveal the curtain and send a group of unedited pictures that included key identifiers (face and rooms). Oh holy jesus how shit went down. I only wish i had some way to see how they reacted. Friends who still lived there told me her brother moved in with his dad that week and that they no longer spoke. All in all, about 4 months till i got my revenge but it was amazing. EDIT: YOU GODDAMN SONS OF BITCHES. Someone told my Ex about it and now she finally knows forsure that it was me. HAHAHAH. Sucks for her i now live 2000 miles away for college but jesus christ reddit. Dont go shooting your mouth off.
Friend and I were fishing at a local creek when my friends brother pulled up. Being the dick he normally was he started throwing rocks in the creek to scare the fish and then he threw my friends bike in the creek. We were 13 at the time, my friend was crying and I felt so bad. I jumped into the creek and got his bike out, told him we would get his brother back. About a month later we were fishing again and it was the dead of summer. I told my friend today is the day we get his brother back. Caught a 2/3 pound carp, threw it up on the side of the bank and left it there until we were done fishing. At the end of the night went back to his place his brothers car was sitting on the street, we took the carp sliced it open and threw it under the drivers seat and rolled his windows 3/4 up. The next morning when we woke and left I forgot about what we had done. Well when I rode past JT's car I noticed the window was kind of black and then I took a closer look it was covered in flies. I actually got scared because I did not expect to a window caked with flies. By the time I got home I was laughing in tears because his brother was always such a dick to us. Fast forward to baseball practice about 3 days later, friend had a black eye but smiled at me when we made eye contact. His brother flipped out and ran into his house and punched him in the face. His mom flipped out on his brother, brother was grounded for the rest of summer. His mom said that my friend would never do such a thing and he played along and acted as if he had no idea. Apparently the smell never really left the car. We nicknamed his brother lord of the flies.
Edit: (Woah obligatory front page) Thanks chefs, cooks and homecookers- lots of great tips! Here are some of the top tips: Use good tools- Things are better and easier when you use good pans and knives. Whenever you're sautéing, frying, or wok-ing don't crowd the pan. Prep all of your stuff before starting to cook. Read the whole recipe before you begin cooking. Meat continues cooking after you take it off the grill Butter Awesome steak technique from ironicouch "My friend's mother taught me how to cook steak a few months back, so far it has not failed me. You have to make sure your steak is dry, use a paper towel to dry it off. Heat the skillet before putting the steak on, you want to hear it sizzle when you place it in the pan. Rub the steak down with just a little olive oil and some sea salt and then place it in the pan for until it starts browning, so it doesn't take long on the stove, then put in the oven at 400 degrees F, for 10 minutes or even less depending on how rare you like it. Everyone has their own method, but this was the simplest way I have heard it being made, and it always tastes fantastic." Another great steak cooking tip from FirstAmendAnon "Alright, this is a great method, but leaves out a few important details. Here's the skinny on getting you perfect steakhouse quality steaks at home: Buy a thick cut of meat like a porterhouse. If its more than 2" thick it's usually better. Look for a lot of marbling (little white lines of fat through the meat). The more the better. Stick the meat unwrapped on a rack in the fridge overnight (watch out for cross-contamination! make sure your fridge is clean). This ages the meat and helps dry it out. Then like an hour before you cook take it out of the fridge, pat it down with paper towels, and leave it out until your ready to season. Preheat your oven to really hot, like 500F, and stick your (ovensafe!) pan in there. That will ensure your pan is super hot and get a sear on your meat quickly. Season both sides of the steak with coarse salt and like a teaspoon of oil. I find peanut oil to be better than olive oil but it doesn't really make much difference. Pan out of the oven using a thick oven mitt. Stick your steak in there, it should hiss loudly and start to sear immedietly. This is the goodness. 2 minutes on both sides, then stick about three tablespoons of room temperature butter and three sprigs of fresh rosemary on top of the steak and throw that baby in the oven. after about 3 minutes, open the oven (there will be lots of smoke, run your fan), and flip the steak. 2 or three more minutes, pull it out. If you like it more on the well done side, leave it a little longer. Do not leave it for more than like 5 minutes because you might as well just make hamburgers. Take it off the heat. Using a wooden spoon or large soup spoon tilt the pan and repeatedly spoon the butter and juices onto the steak. Baste in all its glory. Let the meat rest for about five minutes. I use that time to make the plate prettified. Mash potatoes or cheesy grits on the bottom. Brussel sprouts on the side. Maybe some good goats cheese on top of the steak. Be creative. This method is guaranteed to produce a bomb diggity steak. Like, blowjob-inducing 100% of the time. It's really high-heat and ingredient driven though, so be careful, and spend that extra $5 on the good cut of meat. EDIT: As a couple of people below have mentioned, a well-seasoned cast iron pan is best for this method. Also, the 5th bullet is slightly unclear. You take the hot pan out of the oven, place it on the stovetop with the stovetop on full heat, and sear the steak for 2min ish on both sides. Then cut off the stovetop and put the steak in the oven."
If you have no idea what I'm talking about: Original Post from three months ago and Update 1. HuffPo Writeup TLDR: I traveled. Reddit gave me things to do. I did them Hey Reddit, I've had a crazy, crazy summer and have you guys to thank. My travels brought me across the US and Canada, through rural Thailand, to Seoul and Sydney. Over the last three months I have met hundreds of redditors and gone on some cool adventures. Highlights include: Carwashing for oliversmom - you can read more about Oliver here Mr. Duck Stickers left everywhere Portrait painted Help a dude move Barcraft, Seattle Weeding (Zajoba pictured) Aerial Tour, Seattle Motion Capture for Valve Ride an Elephant Teaching English, Thailand GSL Code S Final, Seoul Tastosis signatures for Redditor John the Translator Picture for a redditor couple Interview Moving a couch: hardmode, Denver Giant spiders in Australia Pubcrawl, Sydney Forensics guest lecture, Sydney Toured the NYSE Rocket Museum, Huntsville Rappeling Eat a "Gripper", Calgary Attend the 100th Calgary Stampede (also, barcraft) Waterfight, Calgary Bobsledding, Calgary Letters, Edmonton (yet to be delivered) Originally I was planning on traveling through till the end of July but surprise tooth ache had me grounded early (turns out I need my wisdom teeth removed). I've been home for the last week, catching up on sleep and getting organized for the upcoming school year (which starts next week). I also donated the money I raised (via reddit) for filming costs since I managed to stay underbudget all trip (mainly by living off of the hospitality of redditors instead of staying in hostels). I'm interested in doing something similar next summer, but on a bigger scale/actually organized. Something where you could vote on where to send me a on week to week basis. In the mean time I'm going to work on turning the footage I took this summer into something (short documentary or music video or something). I just wanted to thank everyone once again, -Daniel / 'Reddit Travel Guy' EDIT: I'll be doing an AMA this Sunday starting at noon PST Obligatory link to the subreddit I kept Preview of footage from thailand
So I've been watching HBO's Rome and Generation Kill simultaneously and it's lead me to fantasize about traveling back in time with modern troops and equipment to remove that self-righteous little twat Octavian (Augustus) from power. Let's say we go back in time with a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), since the numbers of members and equipment is listed for our convenience in this Wikipedia article, could we destroy all 30 of Augustus' legions? We'd be up against nearly 330,000 men since each legion was comprised of 11,000 men. These men are typically equipped with limb and torso armor made of metal, and for weaponry they carry swords, spears, bows and other stabbing implements. We'd also encounter siege weapons like catapults and crude incendiary weapons. We'd be made up of about 2000 members, of which about half would be participating in ground attack operations. We can use our four Abrams M1A1 tanks, our artillery and mechanized vehicles (60 Humvees, 16 armored vehicles, etc), but we cannot use our attack air support, only our transport aircraft. We also have medics with us, modern medical equipment and drugs, and engineers, but we no longer have a magical time-traveling supply line (we did have but the timelords frowned upon it, sadly!) that provides us with all the ammunition, equipment and sustenance we need to survive. We'll have to succeed with the stuff we brought with us. So, will we be victorious? I really hope so because I really dislike Octavian and his horrible family. Getting Atia will be a bonus. Edit - Prufrock451 Big thanks to Prufrock451 for bringing this scenario to life in a truly captivating and fascinating manner. Prufrock clearly has a great talent, and today it appears that he or she has discovered that they possess the ability to convey their imagination - and the brilliant ideas it contains - to people in a thoroughly entertaining and exciting way. You have a wonderful talent, Prufrock451, and I hope you are able to use it to entertain people beyond Reddit and the internet. Thank you for your tremendous contribution to this thread. Mustard-Tiger Wow! Thank you for gifting me Reddit Gold! I feel like a little kid who's won something cool, like that time my grandma made me a robot costume out of old cereal boxes and I won a $10 prize that I spent on a Thomas the Tank Engine book! That might seem as if I'm being unappreciative, but watching this topic grow today and seeing people derive enjoyment from all the different ideas and scenarios that have been put forward by different posters has really made my day, and receiving Reddit Gold from Mustard-Tiger is the cherry on the top that has left me feeling just as giddy as that little kid who won a voucher for a bookshop. Again, thank you very much, Mustard-Tiger. I'm sure I will make good use of Reddit Gold. Thank you to all the posters who've recommended books, comics and movies about alternative histories and time travel. I greatly appreciate being made aware of the types of stories and ideas that I really enjoy reading or watching. It's always nice to receive recommendations from people who share your interest in the same things. Edit - In my head the magical resupply system only included sustenance, ammo and replacement equipment like armor. Men and vehicles would not be replaced if they died or were destroyed. I should have made that clear in my OP. Okay, let's remove the magical resupply line, instead replacing it with enough equipment and ammo to last for, say, 6 months. Could we destroy all of the Roman Empire in that space of time before our modern technological advantages ceased to function owing to a lack of supplies? Edit 3 - Perhaps I've over estimated the capabilities of the Roman forces. If we remove the tanks and artillery will we still win? We now have troops, their weapons, vehicles for mobility (including transport helicopters), medics and modern medicine, and engineers and all the other specialists needed to keep a MEU functional.
DAY 1 The 35th MEU is on the ground at Kabul, preparing to deploy to southern Afghanistan. Suddenly, it vanishes. The section of Bagram where the 35th was gathered suddenly reappears in a field outside Rome, on the west bank of the Tiber River. Without substantially prepared ground under it, the concrete begins sinking into the marshy ground and cracking. Colonel Miles Nelson orders his men to regroup near the vehicle depot - nearly all of the MEU's vehicles are still stripped for air transport. He orders all helicopters airborne, believing the MEU is trapped in an earthquake. Nelson's men soon report a complete loss of all communications, including GPS and satellite radio. Nelson now believes something more terrible has occurred - a nuclear war and EMP which has left his unit completely isolated. Only a few men have realized that the rest of Bagram has vanished, but that will soon become apparent as the transport helos begin circling the 35th's location. Within an hour, the 2,200 Marines have regrouped, stunned. They are not the only moderns transported to Rome. With them are about 150 Air Force maintenance and repair specialists. There are about 60 Afghan Army soldiers, mostly the MEU's interpreters and liaisons. There are also 15 U.S. civilian contractors and one man, Frank Delacroix, who has spoken to no one but Colonel Nelson.
Today on the train I sat next to a woman who was angry that I sat next to her because she wanted the two seats to herself. As I sat there she kept mouthing under her breath how she just wanted to sit there alone... blah blah blah. Despite the fact that I wanted to tell her that it was public transportation and she needed to get over it I kept my mouth shut. A few minutes later a large woman with a large purse comes and stands in the same car I was in. I get her attention and tell her that she could have my seat. She huffs and puffs her way to me and I help her sit down while grinning at the angry woman who was upset I'd sat beside her. I enjoyed watching her head almost explode from anger as the other large woman's rolls and purse pressed against her for the rest of the ride. Anyone else have any of those subtle revenge stories? Edit: of course the one time I don't check reddit, because I think my story was lame and won't get more than five comments, it takes off. I am looking forward to reading all these stories.... Oh and I'd like to thank all the people that made this possible... my producer, all the guys in Fresno, Melvin, all the haters who said I'd never make it, Phil Collins, OAG, GGG, the White House... yadda yadda yadda... Edit again: This lady is a regular and a known seat hog. I've seen her get into arguments before with people because she wants two seats to herself. Everyone pays to ride the train so if there is a seat open then it's up for grabs.
I was working as a manager in a big nightclub about a year ago. I dont wear a uniform, but have a radio and run the security team. The venue has a great smoking section that looks out onto the street. One night the venue was packed so I did my usual roam making sure that there were no problems, however it wasg too packed to walk through the smoking section, so I walked down the street instead, but could still very easily see into the smoking section. One guy stares me down, then calls me over, and starts swearing at me for no reason and telling me that "pieces of shit like you could never even get into a venue like this". He obviously had no idea I was the manager, however I didn't want to have security get into a fight inside with him. The guy kept telling me he would punch me out etc. and was clearly trying to look macho to impress someone. So I agreed and told him to come and meet me outside and he could even have a free swing. He puts his drink down, takes off his jacket and storms outside. Once he walked outside, I walked back inside and told security not to let him back in. The look on his face when he realised I ran the place was priceless, and then the realisation that he couldnt get back into the club was amazing. It was the easiest and most fun removal I have ever done.
Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tenoq/reddit_my_friends_call_me_a_scumbag_because_i/ Okay, the past month and a half has been insane. Like I said in my last post, the code was originally signed to only run on the desktop that I was assigned, and also required a password upon starting. I felt secure in that they couldn't steal and rip the code and fire everyone. I then went to my manager and told him what I was doing. He asked me (In Dutch...) "Is the program still on the work desktop, and did you do it on company time?" I replied yes, and yes. I was promptly fired and expelled from the building. Once I left, I called my bosses superior (? or inferior?? the one higher...) and left him a voice mail saying what happened and that my boss fired me for it, but I thought he was being close minded and not open to advancing the company. I also got a call from my manager, telling me I have to give him the password... I told him I am no longer employed and am not required to any longer. I get a call from my bosses boss, and he asks to have a meeting with me to discuss what actually happened and if it is true that it could save money, he would listen. but I was hellbent on refusing to give out the password. Not to be mean/defensive, but the code was not designed for anyone to use, it was very primitive in the way it had to be setup. I didn't want to be liable for someone using it incorrectly. I met with him a week later, we discussed over tea about the program. I asked if I was doing anything wrong or immoral, and he said that the only issue was that I coded it on company time when I wasn't supposed too, and that the app not only was fine (no requirement to have it done by a person), but also saved the money lots and lots of money and they never even realized it. (They would have had to hire more people to handle the load, but didn't because everything was getting done.) Once we talked about it, he said I was very talented and asked why I worked in the line of work I do instead of software engineering, I replied that I found this job first and was making such great money-- which he didn't expect, and asked me how much I was making, me telling him the true amount. He was floored and cracked up laughing, I made more than my boss (but not the guy I was talking too). He told me he would love to give me a job doing software engineering for the entire companies systems. I agreed only if that the current employees wouldn't be fired and would be put into different places in the company. We came to a compromise that some of the useless people (There were a few...) would be let go (these people are morons beyond belief), but that he could find jobs for the rest (Translation was a big one, since us Dutch people have a culture of learning others languages, sales, HR and other departments, and a few of them were offered training for the jobs. A handful was kept on the original team but their job was changed from manual input to now they work with the tool I built. As far as I know, the bonus program was slashed a lot, but they're still making more bonus than before I bet since I was taking it all) So now I am a lead software engineer over my own department, making the same base pay as I was making base+bonus previously. (No bonus, unfortunately haha) Most other workers moved departments or changed jobs in their department, so most people got a good deal. Except my boss. They were upset with him before this, and were even more upset after him. He was notoriously a bad manager and he was fired over this. Oh well. They hired one of the previous people on my team to take over his job :) TL;DR IT WORKED OUT FOR 99% OF THE PEOPLE. EDIT: one thing is worse: my new desk chair sucks
Reposting this top-level because it was buried under a shitty comment: There is an answer to the question "Why is it so bad?" The answer is because the submission titles on this site suck. Very, very badly. They're generally non-descriptive and useless. People use submission titles as punchlines to a joke, not as an actual title. If a submission is titled "Look what I found", and it's a picture of a gold dubloon, what are you going to search for when you look for it 2 months later? "Gold coin", "gold dubloon", or something. You're not going to search for "Look what I found", because a) You won't have remembered that title, and b) That would turn up about a million results. Go to a subreddit that enforces submission titles (try the SFW-Porn network, they generally have very good titles), and try searching for something (restricted to that subreddit of course). I guarantee you'll get what you're looking for, if it exists. I've been saying this for a long time, but I'll say it again: Reddit should have a system which allow users to tag submissions with keywords, like "gold coin", "dubloon", and other descriptive words, which would then be weighted heavily in search results, based on how many times a post was tagged with a certain phrase or word. If 20 people tag a post with "gold coin", that will be weighted very heavily in the search results, and will probably be the #1 result when someone searches for "gold coin", even though the submission contained none of those words and just linked to an image hosted on imgur. The tags would be hidden from the public for the first hour or two (same as the vote count), so as not to encourage the same type of hivemind bias that exists with the voting system.
As a man that has reached the ripe old age of 48 I can promise you I have seen some shit go down. This one totally takes the cake for me though. I was waiting out front of a truck stop back in the mid 80's. Sitting on a park bench with a guy that had a big Rottweiler kinda dog on a leash with him. I tried to make small talk but he was quite a sourpuss. So we sat in silence for a few minutes until the most unexpected thing I have ever seen, happened right before my very eyes. While we were sitting there a big 18 wheeler pulls in without a trailer (bobtail) so he parks right up front like a normal car would. Inside the cab of the truck with the driver is a little monkey. The dance for the organ grinder kind. I think they are called Rhesus monkeys perhaps. Well the dog spots this lil monkey and proceeds to go apeshit over it. Lunging at the end of his leash and barking at the top of his lungs. Generally making a real spectacle of himself to say the least. The driver is obviously upset, but not nearly as much as the monkey is. Actually upset may be the wrong adjective to use for the monkey though. In retrospect I think eagerly aggressive may be a more appropriate description for his disposition. He was pacing the dashboard back and forth. Never taking his eyes off of this very aggravating dog. The driver opens his little triangle window that they don't make on cars anymore. The ones made for smokers back in the day. He yells out to this douche bag to call his dog off because it is upsetting his monkey. The guy laughs and says no way (I told you he was a jerk didn't I?). Says that his dog ain't bothering nobody. The dog hasn't shut up since he laid eyes on the monkey. I promise you he is bothering everybody for several blocks around. Now here's where things start to get interesting. The driver says that if he doesn't call his dog off he's gonna let his monkey loose on that dog. Douche bag laughs and says that his dog would eat that monkey alive. Upon hearing this the driver leans over and reaches into his glove box I guess. Pulls out one of those tiny baseball bats like you used to get at Astroworld or carnivals, and places it in the monkeys hand. The monkey obviously knows what's about to go down because he is now trying to squeeze out of that little triangular window I mentioned earlier. This monkey has murder in his eyes if I have ever seen it. Driver hollers "Last chance to save your dog's ass man." In response douche bag lets his dog off of the leash. Now we have a situation that has escalated to the point where we have a dog jumping up at the window and a monkey screaming profanities right back at him. Well, the driver finally rolls down the regular window and out leaps all kinds of miniature primate hell. The dog never knew what hit him. Quick as a flash this monkey is riding on the back of this dog's neck. His two back feet all wrapped up in his neck fur with one hand hanging onto an ear. The other hand as you may have guessed by now is steadily and mercilessly raining down blows about this dog's head and face. I mean hard blows. You can hear them whap whap whap. Well it only took a moment for the dog to realize he was in way over his head. He bolts yelping bloody murder as he runs away at full speed. I mean this dog is running so fuckin hard he's throwing up tufts of grass and dirt as soon as he leaves pavement. The monkey still riding him and beating on him the whole time. Douche bag acts like he wants to fight now but several people including myself stepped in to stop that nonsense. In a couple of minutes or so the little monkey comes loping back with his little bat still in hand, and leaps up into the still open window of the truck to await his master who has gone on into the store. That wanker ran off to try to go find his dog, but I don't know if he ever did. My ride showed up and I had to go. Never again in this lifetime will I see something so totally crazy and unexpected like that. I am both fortunate and humble to have been so privileged to be present for such an event. So Reddit, please do tell. What's your craziest thing you have ever seen in public? TL:DR Small monkey beats the shit out of large dog.
Was having a new exhaust put onto my Subaru by a small specialty shop in Buffalo, NY. We dropped it off and then said we would just go walk around for a couple hours till it was done. Staff advised us not too as it was a rough area...we were 19, and from Canada, whats the worst that could happen? After walking through a couple blocks of burnt out hoses, and straight out of the movies (for us) ghetto w decided to turn around and get back to the shop ASAP! We walk around a corner only to see a group of 5 large, thugish looking young black men ahead of us, they notice us, turn and walk in our direction. Instant brick shitting...do we run...do we plead for our lives? We decide to do the Canadian thing and just keep walking like nothings going to happen. The "gang" reaches us after a few seconds, kind of does a half circle around the two of us, there is no escape, only robbery or death. What appears to be the leader makes contact "Yo, we got a question for you guys!". We sheepishly reply"uhhh yea?"
UPDATE: Wow... Just wow. 14 thousand comments and counting. I'm humbled and grateful for every one of the comments, upvotes and the endless amounts of music suggestions. Currently the most upvoted comment isn't a song suggestion but rather a suggestion to listen to the music from the beginnings of its orgins. Here's the original comment below as submitted by GiraffeKiller- "This is like introducing an Alien to the music of Earth. I wouldn't know where to start. Once you're through your kick on Classical, I might start with music from the 50's and progress through each decade. You can really see the growth of modern music like that." I think it's a wonderful idea, and will be blogging about my journey into the world of music. As many of you have pointed out; music didn't start in the 50's, so I'm going to start with the earliest written form of music… I'm going to start with Guillaume de Machaut's Agnus Dei. (Composed sometime between 1313 and 1365) I am still posting my top 5 next week... It will be a difficult task considering all the submissions. This week I am going to re-watch my favorite film of all time, Baraka. This will be my first time being able to hear the soundtrack of the film. I will be posting about that as well. Also for all of those asking- the hearing aids I got is the Phonak Naida S Premium. Again, thank you for all the kind words and shares! Even if you’re not hearing music for the first time ever, I suggest looking through the suggestions and expanding your musical tastes. You never know how much more days you have left to hear.... Trust me on this one, you don’t want to miss out on a great song. I've never understood it. My whole life I've seen hearing people make a fool of themselves singing their favorite song or gyrating on the dance floor. I've also seen hearing people moved to tears by a single song. That was the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around. I was born profoundly deaf and all music sounded like trash through my hearing aids. That is until a couple days ago when I put on a new pair of hearing aids for the first time in years. The first thing I heard was my shoe scraping across the carpet; it startled me. I have never heard that before and out of ignorance, I assumed it was too quiet for anyone to hear. I sat in the doctor's office frozen as a cacophony of sounds attacked me. The whir of the computer, the hum of the AC, the clacking of the keyboard, and when my best friend walked in I couldn't believe that he had a slight rasp to his voice. He joked that it was time to cut back on the cigarettes. That night, a group of close friends jump-started my musical education by playing Mozart, Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Sigur Ros, Radiohead, Elvis, and several other popular legends of music. Being able to hear the music for the first time ever was unreal. I realized that my old hearing aids were giving me a distorted version of music. they were not capable of distributing higher frequencies with clarity, instead it was just garbled gibberish. When Mozart's Lacrimosa came on, I was blown away by the beauty of it. At one point of the song, it sounded like angels singing and I suddenly realized that this was the first time I was able to appreciate music. Tears rolled down my face and I tried to hide it. But when I looked over I saw that there wasn't a dry eye in the car. I finally understood the power of music. Obviously, I did the only sensible thing and went on a binge of music. Below are my top 5 favorites from my limited exposure to the world of sound. Mozart's Lacrimsoa The soundtrack to Eleven Eleven… I can see how this comes off as narcissistic, it being my own film and all but it's such a personal work that when I listened to it for the first time I broke down. I felt like I was truly seeing the film for the first time ever. I'm grateful that Cazz was able to capture the tone perfectly. We discussed the film and specific scenes with essay-sized reasoning/deliberations on what should be conveyed. The critical response to the film surprised me and I still didn't quite get it until seeing the visual images coupled with the soundtrack. Sig Ros's Staralfur IL Postino-Luis Bacalov Minnesota's A Bad Place Ironically enough, I'm turning my hearing aids off more often than before because most sounds are even more annoying and the only times I have it on is when talking to people or listening to music/birds. Silence is still my favorite sound. When I turn my aids off my thoughts become more clear and it's absolutely peaceful. I hope that one day hearing people get the opportunity to experience utter silence. What exactly changed between my old hearing aids and my new ones? My previous hearing aids were only 4 years old but technology has gotten cheaper and better at an exponential rate since then. Before, I could almost hear the low frequencies at a hearing person’s level, but not as crisp... higher notes on the other hand, I didn’t hear at all. I never realized how little of a range my hearing aids picked up compared to hearing people until a telecommunications class in college. We were learning about radio equipment and the guest professor told us about how high human ears can hear and also compared to various animals. He turned around and turned the dial down to the lower pitches. I could still hear nearly all the low frequencies like rest of the class. When he turned the dial in the opposite direction, I blanked out at about 40% and the rest of the class stopped between 90-100%. It’s an odd feeling learning something so profound about yourself at twenty one... But it’s not as odd as the things I can hear now. It was during Lacrimosa that I realized I was truly hearing pitches I’ve never experienced before. It was like seeing a color I’ve never seen before. I honestly never thought I would really be able to hear my own soundtracks because I have accepted my deafness, I have always been and still am grateful for all I've been blessed with so it was never a big deal to me. Now... I'm overwhelmed and beyond grateful. But this is just the beginning. That’s why I’m asking you to give me the name of the most beautiful songs to you. I’ve posted the question on reddit and will listen to the top 30 upvotes and then post my top 5 from that batch.

You know that awkward moment when you and a stranger are walking towards each other but need to get past each other and you get confused and end up doing a left to right dance? Not for me! When I walk through large crowds of people, to avoid walking into anyone, I simply stare at my destination. I look no one in the eyes. People actually will watch your eyes and they avoid the direction you are going. If I look into people's eyes as we are walking into each other, we are sure to collide. You have to let people know where you intend to go with your eyes. It always works for me, try it! Your turn, teach me some good mind tricks! *Edit- Wow I didn't know there were that many "mind tricks"! Thanks Redditors for your knowledge and wisdom! *Edit-Thank you masterthenight for the comment: "To add onto the OP comment, simply turning your head to indicate which direction you are going works as well." *Edit- One of the best responses I've heard comes from WhatAppearsToBeADuck: Tell any male adolescent that you think their voice is high. Their voice will immediately drop on their response. *Edit- another good comment from dmalfoy123: When you're driving, stare at the back of someone's head or their rear-view mirror and focus all your energy. They will eventually change lanes.
In what was posted on r/cyberlaws a few hours ago, it seems there is going to be a legal battle between Conde Nast and Warner Bross. I think the community has grown pass being a property of anyone, and I think a lot of us were unaware of this "User Agreement" between us the users and this company named Reddit. I love Reddit dearly with all my heart, it has brought a lot of happiness to a lot of users, some of that was thanks to the fact that people did not need to worry about copyrights, and I hate to see it crumble to become a patent/copyright troll on the back of its users. I'm not sure how it should be done legally, but I think that paragraph has no place in such place as Reddit, and I as a user will definitely change my behaviour on reddit as a result of finding out about it. Lost all control over the incoming messages and comments. I apologize if I'm not answering - feel free to send direct message on specific questions. alienth responded that they checking into this, and my comment with a couple of questions got downvoted and disappeared, so here are the questions I'm still hoping to get answers to: Can you give us more details? Can you in the meanwhile remove that pargraph? When is it going to be actually changed? Are we going to be allowed to comment on the new user agreement before it is imposed on the community?

Mine is when I went to the Oatmeal homepage and right clicked and did view page source. (OK SO JUST SAYING MY FRIEND TOLD ME TO DO THIS I TECHNICALLY DIDN'T FIND IT BUT I REALIZED THERE WAS A COMIC) [This came up.] (http://imgur.com/i2CvS) Then I saw that in the words by the PTERODACTYL's mouth it said HTTP://PTERODACTYL.ME so I went there and well [this] (http://theoatmeal.com/comics/ptero) is what it brought me to. I was impressed. [EDIT] OK so i wasnt sure if the http address would work so I added the other one they are the same. Just chill about it. [EDIT] WOW!! I never expected this to become soooo big thank you all! Even getting close to the front page is amazing! Again THANK YOU ALL!! [EDIT] Again how did this get so much upvotes. I am surprised. It is the end of my first month of Reddit and I like to think I am doing pretty well..... [EDIT] Nobody is here anymore but someone just commented about a couple days ago. I thought this was archived. I love cats. Cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat. rape. Dead people. Pigeon. I hope someone sees this. And my penis. I have a girlfriend. Gay faggot shit chips. I'm not crazy..
My story: When I was 13 a doctor wrote me an adult dose for a certain medicine based on my weight. I was a fat kid. Our body does not work that way and the medicine ended up constipating me...for a month. I did not shit for a whole month. I got sick. I had racoon-like eyes, my stomach would jump or flutter by itself, I had cramps, etc. It was bad. I was miserable. I finally told my parents how long it had been since i had shit and they freaked out and took me to the hospital. There, they gave 3 enemas back to back. After the third and final one, all that water softened all that shit up just enough i could expel it. I ran to the nearest bathroom, gown open in the back, and tried to make it to the toilet. I didn't My ass was hovering at a 45 degree angle above the toilet when the geyser burst. This next part is not a lie, but i know some of you will think it is, I got shit everywhere. On the ceiling (somehow), on the floor, the toilet was covered, the walls, even the sink got hit with some spray. Shit was literally, yes literally, sprayed on all walls and ceiling. It was everywhere. I felt like a new kid after that. Cleaned myself up the best i could and then had to figure out what to do. There was no way i could clean it all up, I needed a janitor. So I walked out and politely told a nurse the bathroom need a clean up and badly.
Link to original So, amazingly, crustlessmist and jwild98 determined the correct license and created a damning visual aid to show it within hours of my original submission. I gave the information to the police, who took over a week to respond to me, but said that they located the owner of that license and served papers to them. Meanwhile, I had given the same information to my insurance provider: Geico. They ended up telling me that the other party was also insured with Geico and had submitted a claim just after the accident happened, claiming that they were involved in a hit and run(!). I asked and the agent told me that they claimed the car was parked and unoccupied when it was hit. The other agent got a recorded statement from me over the phone, which was extremely formal. She was all business until she asked if she could stop recording and I said yes, after which she said, "Woooooow. I haven't had one like this in a long time!" After some talking and investigation by Geico, they determined that I was the innocent party and I finally got a car rental from them (after a month of sharing a van with my wife and three kids, which is a pain when you need to get to work early). They didn't want to give me the rental earlier because they didn't know whether MY uninsured motorist insurance should pay for it or if we would find the other party and make their insurance pay for it. Geico found out that the insured person's son had been driving that night and decided to lie about the accident when they got home. I still figure he must have been doing something illegal at the time since he had insurance and still didn't stop. I don't know, though. The police never told me his name and haven't contact me further regarding the issue. Yesterday, they finally inspected and estimated the repairs my car would need. Today, they told me that they were declaring it a total loss and they will give me $2,800 (and change) for my 2000 Buick LeSabre Ltd. I'm not a car guy, but I remember him saying something along the lines of the "rails" being warped and the quarterpanels being bowed out and some other things. They were just looking at body damage and it was over the value of the car (it's not counting the mechanical damage that was done). I have until Friday to determine if I want to accept the offer for the title. Geico also said they would pay for my medical bills, but it's a one time payment after treatment is ended. I have to give them HIPAA permission to get my bills from my medical providers and they will pay them. They also mentioned something about "mental anguish" and "suffering" but never mentioned a number. I guess a month without my normal convenient mode of travel and initially not being able to walk without immense pain after the accident count as anguish and suffering... so how much is that worth? I can't really think of an amount that I'd be happy to take if it were going to happen to me again. So one day I'm sitting at a red light, minding my own business and a month and a half later I've lost my primary vehicle for an amount of money that can't cover a comparable vehicle. Still, it was exciting to hunt down the offender and at least get him to be held accountable for his prevarications and douchebaggery. Thank you for all of the help, reddit! Edit: saw the wall of text after I submitted and determined I should add a tl;dr TL;DR: Cops found ass who hit me and ran. Geico also found him. Ass had claimed hit-and-run on his own vehicle. Geico determined I was right and he was wrong. Geico says it will pay for my medical bills. Geico totals my car and offers me $2,800 (I have until Friday to accept). I now have no car. Edit: It is amazingly difficult to keep up with the waves of people crashing into this thread. I just want people to know that I'm doing my best to read the comments, even if I'm not responding to all of them. And I'm totally getting the feeling that I need to speak to a lawyer. :) Thank you. Edit: Wow! The number 1 spot on the front page! And I didn't even misspell anything in the title or make any glaring grammatical errors! To think I was just sitting here tonight browsing reddit and kind of half-assedly thought, "I guess after today I have enough to give them a decent update... yeah, ok, I'll write it out." I should have taken a picture of my empty driveway and posted it and then I could have reaped all of this sweet karma. Edit: I just looked up the guy's name in the court website and found out that he's got a hearing coming up on the 14th. He was charged with "Failure to Stop / Accident - MISD" and the code section is here. It says that it should be a Class 5 Felony. This page says that a class 5 felony is punishable by a jail term of 1 to 10 years, or up to a year in jail and/or up to $2,500 in fines. The court website lists that as the code section, but it also lists the type of case as a Class 1 Misdemeanor. I should call and tell them my car just got totaled.
Shortly after my mom died, I was drunk as hell at a bar in my hometown (which was a frequent occurrence in those days). I was having a rough night, so I went outside to sit on the curb and have a cigarette. This older gentleman, probably around 60-65 sat down next to me because he said I reminded him of his daughter and he wanted to help me feel better if he could. I talked to this guy for a good hour, about my mom, about my life, about dropping out of college and basically losing control of everything because I couldn't deal with her passing. He gave me some of the best advice I've ever received and made me feel like things could really be okay again, eventually. He waited there with me until the bar closed and my friends found me. I gave him a huge hug and tried to thank him as genuinely as I could. I never saw him again and I have no way of finding him, but I think about him all the time and how much of an impact a total stranger had on my life. Edit: the advice he gave me is further down this thread, sorry!
Edit: Wow! I wasn't expecting so many awesome ideas. Keep them coming! In a couple hours we'll be going shopping to pick up everything we need for a day of science. Edit 2: You guys are amazing. I'm still reading through all the suggestions, but these are the ones we'll definitely be doing: Corn starch & water Volcano Mentos + Diet Coke, followed by soda bottle vortex Pepper in a bowl of water Moebius strip Penny and nickel battery Egg in a bottle Soap, milk and food coloring Crushed soda can Film canister rocket Liquid with layered colors Cork rocket Frozen bubbles Supercooled water Clouds in a bottle Update: I smell like vinegar and have food coloring all over my hands, but we had a ton of fun. We didn't quite get to everything this afternoon, but now we have supplies for another time. All told, we had to buy about $20 worth of stuff at the grocery store -- there's no way you'll have this much fun with less money! And he learned a lot, too (especially about pressure, which was probably just because it's easiest for me to explain). Thanks so much for everyone who contributed ideas. I'll be visiting this post over and over again to find other fun ideas for future lazy Saturdays:)
I used to work at Claires and The Icing (same company). We got about 15 minutes of training before we were allowed to pierce kids' ears. If people bled on the ear piercing guns, we would simply wipe them off with a tissue, and use them again on the next person. We were also never taught anything about cross-contamination and blood borne pathogens during training. I would never take my kids to get their ears pierced at the mall. Choose a reputable body piercer and take your kids there. Some people are afraid of taking their kids to body piercers because they look sketchier than the pretty mall down the street, but body piercers will use an autoclave and most of them (if they're any good) are trained to properly deal with blood and bodily fluids. The person at the mall, no matter how much experience they say they have, does not have the proper tools to deal with blood. About 99% of our piercings did not draw blood, but the 1% that do are definitely not dealt with well. I tried my best when I worked there, but there's only so much you can do when there is no equipment on hand to properly sterilize anything.
Just trying to gauge interest for a website concept EDIT: Okay, looks like I'm gonna go for it. Anyone with any sort of website building experience is welcome to give me advice :) EDIT 2: poorstudentscookbook.com is up and running! I'm gonna be working hard throughout the night to figure out how to actually run a website. Recipes and shit will be posted shortly. Thanks for all the interest! EDIT 3: First Recipe is up! Let me know what you guys think! I will accept all criticism. EDIT 4: Yes, I know the website is ugly right now. I promise to make it pretty in the near future, as soon as I start figuring out website development haha EDIT 5: The website is going to be free. I don't know why people think I'm making you pay for the recipes. I'll have ads but that's about it. And there will be a vegetarian section. It's not all going to come together instantly, but I can assure you that by the time school starts (September 1st for me) I will have a fully-functioning website. EDIT 6: A lot of you are messaging me with ideas for my website, and I just want you all to know that while I may not be able to reply to everyone, I'm going to try my best to take any and all suggestions into account. The response I've gotten has been awesome. I promise not to disappoint my fellow redditors!
I'm talking weird occurrences, coincidences you haven't been able to easily explain. I'll start. We have a breakfast laid on at work every morning, just a simple buffet of eggs, bacon what have you. Nothing huge and it's really only to feed about a dozen people or so. I am usually one of the first guys from my team to get to work and the kitchen was deserted as usual. I walked into the little kitchen, there was a ceramic egg tray thing with 12 eggs in it, like the bottom half of an egg carton with a socket for each egg. All spaces are filled with warm freshly boiled eggs. I take one, walk over to the garbage bin, shuck the shell then I walk back over to the food and stop dead. There are 12 eggs in the tray again. No one entered the room while I was peeling the thing. I touched the mystery egg it was the same temp as the other eggs around it. Not a big thing, nothing major, but something very strange. Given one does not get presented with strange eggs from a parallel universe every day I peeled and ate that one too. TL:DR - Found strange quantum egg at breakfast. Ate it. Did not gain super powers. EDIT Holy crap. You magnificent bastards, we're on the front page! Your stories are wonderful, uplifting and truly freaky in equal measure. But it's nice to know other people notice shit like this too. Redditor Wanhope was kind enough to start a subreddit for this topic so feel free to drop in and share your experiences!
This will probably get buried .. When I was around 20, a few years ago, I kept having dreams about a woman with long black hair named Aroura [ pronounced A-roar-uh) . They were different dreams but for some reason, her distinct face and name always ended up in them. It got to the point where I would wake up frustrated and confused, trying to google her name or find out how I was connected to her. After a few months she stopped showing up and I dismissed it, thinking my brain was just being a "scumbag." Fast forward a few years later, Halloween 2009, I'm in the car with a friend stopped at a gas station. I'm about to pull out and merge onto a highway when I get a phone call from a random number, so I stop the car but no one answered. There was a person behind me who grew impatient, honked at me, and then swerved in front of me instead of waiting for 2 seconds for me to move. Second they get on the highway, some silver civic loses control of their wheel and crashes into the car that swerved in front of me. I called the cops and waited at the gas station for them to come. Turns out the drivers of both cars died. It 100% would of been me if I hadn't of got that phone call. Called it back a few hours later out of gratitude and curiosity, rang 3 times and went to voicemail. "Hi, you've reached aurora, please leave your name and number." Never had goosebumps like that in me life.
got the idea from this: http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/c7osn/so_i_rented_a_movie_out_of_one_of_those_redboxdvd/c0qoplp. Post your codes and I'll add them to the list! cheat list: Stop: Stop: Play. Skip advertisements in movies and go strait to the movie. Dial 0 during most automatic menu phone systems to be taken to operator to route your call. also, mashing buttons may work as well. Whenever you have a voice automated phone system, typically saying "representative" gets you someone right away. Update In regards to Cheat Code # 2 I recommend this site: http://gethuman.com/ keep a spare car key in your wallet/purse. If you have a bulky Key that won't fit in your wallet, get a key made that doesn't have the electronic chip on it. It will still unlock the car, it just won't start it. changed by popular request Risk Update: if your wallet is stolen they have your car key. All they need to do is go to your house some time later and take your car out of your driveway. Riding a bicycle will save you lots of money on gas, parking, medical bills, and gym memberships. If you are speeding and suddenly up ahead see a cop that clearly just tagged you, slow down and wave to him/her. Your odds of being pulled over are quite a bit reduced. Don't be rude, but NEVER answer any cops questions when they call you in for questioning. when getting lectured into voice mail, hit 1, pause momentarily. If you aren't put through immediately, hit *, pause. Finally, hit # if neither 1 or * worked. It is called the 1-star-pound technique, and it works for all cell carriers. If your credit card magnetic stripe starts to get worn from use and being in your wallet, and doesn't always read in the card reader, you can use the plastic bag trick. Put the card in a plastic grocery bag and then swipe it. Not sure why it works, but it does.Taking it further though, you can simply apply a piece of quality cellophane tape over the mag stripe for a "permanent" plastic bag trick. At the end of your shower turn the water really (or all the way) cold. This will wake you up and get blood flowing. Update update 9: It also closes your pores to allow for less dirt and bacteria to get in to help reduce acne problems. Macy's credit cards usually have a 20% discount on purchases. I pay with the Macy's card, then while still at the register, I immediately pay off the charge with my debit card. I just got 20% off my purchase and I never get a credit card bill. - this also works with JCP and kohl's cards. im replacing the free movie rental cheat because its unpopular...mostly with movie rental clerks :-/ heres a new one! When you buy something online, you usually get a chance to enter a promo code before you purchase. Google the promo codes. They're out there - you can get anything from free shipping to 25% off the purchase. Turn it off, then on again. Buy things out of season, this can save you money. Unless its food, then buy it in season. When you have forgotten someones name, simply say : "I'm sorry, but what was your name one more time." They may act offended, but when they give you there first name you simply reply "No, I meant your last name." (more socially acceptable to forget). Bingo. First and last names. When eating buffalo wings, the flat portions. You can detach the smaller bone on one end very easily, then twist it a bit and it will just slide out. You're now left with a big hunk of meat and only 1 bone, you can just bite it off into your mouth in one piece, flintstones-style. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRcOY-PvOC8 Gently work an orange in your hands to loosen the peel from the fruit.

If you get a ticket on the windshield of your car, you can potentially get away with parking illegally in the same lot for the rest of the day by keeping the ticket on your windshield. edited reduced from a few days for a single day. Most tinfoil and saran wrap boxes have little push-in tabs on the sides. If you push them in, the roll won't fall out when you try to rip out a sheet of it. Keep a list of all of the credit card phone numbers (1-800) in your cell phone. This way, if your wallet is ever lost, you can call them immediately to have them disabled. It's also a good idea to place all of the cards in your wallet on a copier and print a page to keep at home. This will give you access to your License #, etc. Update: You should update 20. If you lose your wallet.. as in misplace it.. put a hold on your credit cards. Do NOT cancel. If you cancel it can later show up on your credit report. If you believe you are going to find it later, placing a hold saves you the red mark on your report. If you are driving an unfamiliar car and you don't know which side the gas tank is on, just look at the little pump icon next to the gas gauge on the dashboard. The pump handle on the icon will be on the side of the tank. Update: saw the gas tank one on an older reddit, turns out the handle thing is not consistant. But there IS usually a little arrow next to the icon. Second Update 99% of the time the gas door is opposite of the tailpipe. So far, I have only found that early-mid 2000 Pontiac Vibes break this trend. Third update if there is no arrow, then it most likely is on the passenger's side. I've yet to see one without an arrow that wasn't on the passenger's side this tip was unpopular, so im changing it This one changed my life. If you're at home/work/party or GOD forbid your girlfriend's house and the toilet starts to overflow, take the lid off the back reservoir part and lift the long handle as far up as it will go. The water will stop rising and then you can quietly mutter curses at it till it goes back down (which it does, more often than not...) link to a Diagram: http://superhomeideas.com/images/toilet.gif to peel a boiled egg, roll it around on your plate for a while until all of the eggshell is cracked evenly. Then it's easy to remove the complete shell at once. After you boil eggs immediately place them in ice cold water for a few minutes. No vinegar or salt or oil or whatever people use. Shells slip right off you spill any liquid that will stain on your carpet (red wine, juice, etc), pour some salt on it. Work it into the carpet - just rub it in with your hands. Leave it there for a few hours (for serious stains, up to a day) and vacuum it out. Voila, stain gone. If you park in a large parking garage/shopping centre, get out and take a photo on your cell phone of the nearest parking sign (Area B2, etc). You will never lose your car again. If you drive stick and the battery s dead, get some friends, put the key to the on position, put the car in 2nd and push the clutch down. have your friends push your car. when you get a decent speed going let the clutch up.

The fine for this offense (at the university I worked at) was $250, and usually a ban from parking at the university (i.e., booted or towed on sight). College Parking Cheat Code: Anyone who's gone to a college or university knows they usually charge a ridiculous amount of money for parking (usually $300+ for a semester pass or $10+ for the daily passes), a service that should fucking be free for students considering the high cost of education. Fuck them. Buy one daily pass at the beginning of the school year (usually a small paper ticket printed out a machine on the lot), take it home and scan it, photoshop the date for tomorrow, and print. Repeat for the next 4 years. Anyone with even the most rudimentary photoshop skills can pull this off convincingly. Even if your printer is shitty, from behind the tint and glare of a car windshield, it might as well be a 7-11 receipt.

5 min ago my reddit all turned spanish....all the tabs, preferences..etc. I went into preferences and made sure they were checked to english....they were....what is going on? I cant read spanish so I am in need of some help here....i am asking you b/c I cannot find the mod help link b/c I cannot read it. UPDATE- ok- it must have something to do with firefox. And to all of you telling me how to change lang. preference, OF COURSE I TRIED THAT before I posted. On IE all is normal. On my desktop all is normal. On my netbook, using firefox, it is a taco show. I ran the page through google translator and I especially enjoy the rick roll. So anyone know how to un-spanish reddit in firefox? This is the only page it is happening on. EDIT- I must admit this is hilarious. I wish i had paid more attention in spanish class.... UPDATE- So I wake up this morning to about 1500 replies in my inbox that I cannot read. And then I run them through Google translator and most of them say stuff like "the dog is in my pants" and "where is the library". Thanks, reddit. As far as the Spanish problem goes.. I disabled all my firefox extensions, cleared all my cookies and restarted it all again. THE SPANISH IS GONE! I do not know what possessed my computer to run for the border, but I am glad it is back. :)
Obtener una buena cantidad de mantequilla de maní en un cuchillo o una cuchara (esta cantidad varía en función de sus preferencias personales) y se distribuyen de manera uniforme en uno o dos rebanadas de pan para que el pan no se empapada por la jalea.

So I was in a coffee shop this morning studying for a midterm. At one point I look up from my table and I see a twenty dollar bill laying at the feet of an attractive blonde making an order. I assumed it was hers since her wallet was open, so I walked over, picked it up and gave it to her. She took a look in her wallet and had all her money accounted for, so she told me it wasn't hers and said something along the lines of 'finders keepers'. So without thinking I handed the twenty to the cashier to pay for her order and walked back to my table. A few moments later, the blonde walked over to thank me and give me the change. I said "I know that normally guys are supposed to introduce themselves first and then take a girl out for coffee, but since I did this all backwards, how would you like to sit down and give me a chance to introduce myself?" She sat down. We talked. I got her phone number AND a date this weekend. In no way could I have scripted it any better. So Reddit, what is the smoothest thing you or someone else has done or said that ended in a date? EDIT: I scored a date AND the front page! Today was a good day!
ALRIGHT ALRIGHT WE'LL DO IN AMA NEXT MONDAY STARTING AT 10AM PST Thank you everyone for the awesome response. Our traffic just shot up 350% and it's still going up. Sorry about not responding enough, we got entirely overwhelmed by the comments and discussion. There were many serious questions and we think we can try to answer them better in r/IAmA. See you then! I'm one of the founders of Microryza, we're basically like, crushing it. I'm just kidding. Science crowdfunding is hard. But we love what we're doing so much that we dropped out of grad school to spend the past year doing nothing but coding and talking to scientists. We think it's important because when were working in labs, all these brilliant scientists and professors never spent their time in their lab doing research and spent all their time writing grant proposals. We decided that science isn't supposed to work like this. A recent survey by NIH saw that the average PI spends 12 weeks/year writing grant proposals. I wrote a blog post about this and some of the other problems that young scientists face in academia:
A friend of mine had his backpack with his $1400 engineering laptop in it, stolen, while at the campus food court. I had a weird gut feeling it would turn up on Craigslist, or somewhere similar. Everyday for a week I checked Craigslist. Exactly one week later, I found the laptop. This EXTREMELY stupid criminal took a picture of the laptop screen WITH MY FRIEND'S LOGIN NAME. Yeah, very stupid criminal. So I contacted the seller immediately via email and he responded within 20 minutes. I said I'd like to buy the laptop from him. We agreed to meet at a near by parking lot later that day. Next, we called the cops. They agreed to set up a sting on the theif. One of the officers pretended to be a buyer, and approached the thief. The officer acted as if he was examining the laptop, but was actually looking for the serial number. BOOM, it had a matching serial number and they arrested this dumbshit. A week ago (Four months later) the guy was proven guilty, and to my knowledge, is spending a year in prison. Plus, my buddy finally got his laptop back!
When I worked at Hollywood video (before that evil corporation went out of business) a man came into my store and bought one bag of popcorn. When I opened the register he pulled a box cutter out of his pocket and told me to give him all the money. My first reaction was to laugh. I couldn't believe I was being robbed. He then waved the box cutter around and swore he wasn't horsing around to which I told him he wasn't getting anything. He said he'd cut me and I told him good luck climbing over the counter to get me. He then placed his hands on the counter and leaned towards me. I grabbed a box cutter of my own and said look at that, a Mexican stand off. Now here is where it gets silly. The man asked if I was threatening him. I said no sir, still laughing at the situation. He then proclaimed he was calling the police and I said please do. He did and he WAITED for the police to arrive! He told them I brandished a box cutter and threatened his life. I then showed the fine officer our security footage and wouldn't you know it? He arrested my new friend. That's my favorite work story, call it bullshit if you want. So, any great stupid "criminal" stories?

She was telling me about it today and i couldn't think about anything except how horrible high school people can be. So here's the story. This guy set up a facebook event for this party at this big hall and over 120 people RSVP'd. 700+ invited. So it's not like no one knew about it. Considering the amount of people that would know about it and come, even if they hadn't clicked attending, was that high this guy booked a massive hall that could cater for such a large event. This cost him around $1500 which included food, security etc. Then he decided instead of using an iPod, which would probably get lost/stolen on the night, he'd hire a DJ. That cost $400. All of this the host had spent months working his ass off so he was able to actually afford it and hold the 'best party ever!' Come the night of the party, weeks of preperation money and organisation, this party is expected to go off! My sister heads off to this massive venue, 'fashionably late' aswell, and no one else is there. Much to their surprise, It's just an empty hall with lights going on and a DJ doing his thing. Then she finds the host and asks the normal questions; 'where is everyone' etc. He is as baffled as my sister was. Not even his best mates had shown up which was even more surprising. Now this is just the most gut-wrenching part of this whole thing. The host then calls his friends. He asks them 'where the hell are you guys?!' and, obviously on loudspeaker an uproar of laughter comes from the person speaking and you can also hear it in the background. He starts crying and everything, absolutely devastated about what has happened. Not only is he out of pocket at $1900 least and knowing that all your friends possibly organised a boycott for this event . When I was told this story i couldn't stomach how harsh and horrible people can be. I never even though this happened, especially on such a large scale as this. TL;DR Host works for months to be able to afford expenses for a party which was expected to have over 120 people in attendance. No one actually attended except for my sister, her friends, the host, his parents and girlfriend. When he called his mates to see when they'd come, they, as well as many other people in the background, just laughed at him and hung up
Bought a penis-ring to have sex with my ex-GF. The first (and only) time I used it, I set the ring size way too small - basically choked my penis from lack of circulating blood. Completed sex, but the next morning my penis was shriveled (like half its normal flaccid size)and looked like it was covered in really tiny veins everywhere. Went to the ER and it turns out that I caused ischemia in parts of my penis, burst a few blood vessels, and basically destroyed my ability to get an erection for the rest of my life. I am only in my 20's. Edit: I didn’t expect this comment to blow up so much, thank you all for your empathy (and TY for the reddit gold). There are a lot of questions below. This happened three years ago, and my ex broke up with me shortly afterwards. I can still get a semi-erection, maybe 20% of what it was previously if I use viagra. It gets engorged somewhat, but doesn't get 'up' like previously. ED causes a lot of stress, anxiety, worry, etc. no matter what age you are. The worst part was that I really couldn’t confide in anybody what was the source of my stress… my parents especially could see something was wrong whenever I visited, but I just told them that I was upset because my girlfriend broke up with me.
From mtv.com "A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion. "Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle. "Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, 'I'm going to beat the sh-- out of you when we get home! You wait and see!' " The detective said "Robyn F." then used her cell phone to call her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales, who did not answer. "Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, 'I'm on my way home. Make sure the police are there when I get there.'
EDIT 10: Replaced pie charts with columns showing the top percentages EDIT 9: We are back up! Thanks to Ed at Zymic for all the help! EDIT 8: Working with Zymic to get the site back up Last week I setup a survey on a "free" survey account. It was "free" until I tried to retrieve the results. So I promised to make a new one. Here it is. I've been on reddit for a while, and I really enjoy the community. I always wondered who the people of reddit are. So I make a quick survey to find out. This is not a scam. Every single question is optional, you don't have to answer a single question if you don't want to. It's 100% anonymous, I don't ask you a single question about your name or account. You can look through my reddit profile and see that I've been here for a while, and am not just a bot trying to steal data. If you have any questions or suggestions let me know. If you think of any new questions I can add them easily. Now, here's the best part....INSTANT RESULTS!!!! I've created a real-time results page.. That's updated every time someone takes the survey! EDIT: Please upvote if you take the survey, so that others can see it. Thanks! EDIT 2: I am aware that Atheism and Agnostic are not Religions, but there that was the best place to put them. EDIT 3: Results require flash! EDIT 4: Only two people have reported finding the easter egg.....c'mon guys! EDIT 5: Shutting Down Temporarily for troll cleanup EDIT 6: The site has crashed, since it's hosted by some other company, I'm having trouble restoring it. I'll be working on it and get it up as soon as I can, ok it's up, but still being trolled.
My mom is a trucker, this is her story. She was driving through Arizona when she saw what she thought was leaves blowing across the road in the distance. This puzzled her since there's mostly pine trees in northern Arizona. When she finally got to the "leaves" she realized that they were migrating tarantulas, 1000's of them. There were so many of them that her truck was sliding on their guts so she had to slow down. She stopped at the first truck stop and told her co-driver to fuel up (he was sleeping at the time) because she wasn't going to step foot outside after what she just saw. Her co-driver was pissed since it was technically his time off, and he thought she was crazy, until he saw the tarantula guts and legs caked in the inside wheel well of the truck. She also outran a tornado in the midwest. She was about to pull over and take cover until she saw another big rig that was parked on the side of the road get tossed a couple hundred yards like a toy. She called me and told me that she thought she was going to die and wanted her last words to be "I love you" to me. She pulled off the freeway and got to a Wal-Mart, where she ran into the basement where all the staff and customers were taking shelter. After the tornado passed, they stepped out of the basement and into daylight, since the Wal Mart was destroyed.
Where's my Droid. As much as I use some of the other apps (especially the flashlight), I always seem to lose my damn phone in a couch, or god knows where...and it is ALWAYS on vibrate when it happens. So, you text a preselected word or phrase to your phone from a friends phone or what have you, and it automatically turns on the ringer to max volume, and plays until you find it...once you find it, you just hit the found phone button, and the app closes and your ringer settings return to what they were previously. Good stuff. Edit: I use the free version. Obviously the paid version is better (WMD also has the ability to take pictures with front and rear cameras, remotely activate gps, do a remote wipe, can use camera flash to help find it, can white/black list numbers, has a passcode that you can set to keep people from changing your keywords, sim card options, etc. some 'advanced' features are only available in the paid version...and YES there ARE versions of this type of app for the iPhone, but I don't know the names or quality.)
I work from a home office, and this time of year is really slow for my company. Of course, I need to stay close to my computer to respond to emails and calls, but I'd like to find something to do with my time. So Reddit: What can I do with my time at home? I'm a 23 year old American guy who is fairly well rounded (skill and knowledge wise) so you may suggest some things I already know or do, but I'd like any input you guys can get me! I'll update the post as responses roll in. Edit: (8:16 Central Time) Still buried in mail. you guys are awesome. Again- thanks, and keep 'em coming! I'm starting work on a (highly abridged) list, but as several folks have linked, there are many similar lists on reddit and elsewhere.

No judgement, I'm just here to listen. Edit: Wow guys, it's been a journey. It's 1 AM and I have to be up for work tomorrow. I just want to say how happy I am that you all shared this with me. I'll respond to a few more, then I'll be up and back at it tomorrow. Peace <3 Edit2: I lied about going to sleep. I stayed up longer and read more of your guy's comments. It's actually very moving that you'd share all of this with me and I truly thank you. Unfortunately, I have so many comments that I honestly can't keep up with them all. A lot of them have to do with the same issue, so I strongly suggest you read through the thread and connect with some people that are going through the same thing. I'll do my best to comment on a few more, and I PROMISE to read every single last one of your comments. Even if I don't respond, I want you to know that I did/will read it. Goodnight folks. <3 Edit3: Edit2 bothers me. I want to reply to everything. Some of you deserve recognition and I feel like just reading them isn't enough. I see your problems, and I empathize deeply, I just can't reply to every single one. I'm sorry guys. :( Edit4: THANK YOU to those of you out there who are also replying to people! I noticed some comments I was reading already had some replies. You people are saints. :) Edit5: Follow-up. I'm still responding to some of the comments that are coming in, but I also wanted to mention that a fellow Redditor has made and invited me to moderate r/whatsbotheringyou If you would like, we can respond to some of your problems that you submit there in the form of a text-post. Cheers. <3
Hired full time, and I make a good living. My work involves a lot of "data entry", verification, blah blah. I am a programmer at heart and figured out how to make a script do all my work for me. Between co workers, they have a 90% accuracy rating and 60-100 transactions a day completed. I have 99,6% accuracy and over 1.000 records a day. No one knows I do this because everyone's monthly accuracy and transaction count are tallied at the end of the month, which is how we earn our bonus. The scum part is, I get 85-95% of the entire bonus pool, which is a HUGE some of money. Most people are fine with their bonuses because they don't even know how much they would bonus regularly. I'm guessing they get €100-200 bonus a month. They would get a lot more if I didnt bot. So reddit, am I a scumbag? I work about 8 hours a week doing real work, the rest is spent playing games on my phone or reading reddit... Edit: A lot of people are posting that I'm asking for a pat on the back... Nope, I'm asking for the moral delima if my ~90% bonus share is unethical for me to take... Edit2: This post has kept me up all night... hah. So many comments guys! you all are crazy :P
This one really gets me. I had a best friend that died of a heroin overdose last year, and the last time I saw her, I was being irresponsible and skipped out on work so I could hang out with her for the night. We were having fun and drank a little bit at the end of the night, ended up taking some group pictures with us and another friend. Those are the only pictures I have of her with me. I had no idea that that was the last time I was ever going to see her and I got to see her that one last time and by some random stroke of luck, get the only pictures I have of us together because I chose to be irresponsible and say fuck work for that day. I have never been happier to make a "bad" decision than I have been for that, fuck I'd skip work all year if I could see her again. She overdosed about 2 months later, out of nowhere. I found out from the messages on Facebook and it felt like my stomach just disappeared, like I suddenly became empty inside. Life has never been so horrifyingly real and I still get panic attacks sometimes when I think about her, but god damn am I happy I got those pictures from that last time we ever saw each other.
When I was in grade 12 English class we had been reading Death of a Salesman. It was the first class of the day and the Teacher was late. It was odd, but no biggie, so the class just bullshitted to pass the time. Five minutes pass, then ten, when I finally spoke up "Hey, HEY! We should just keep reading from where we left off yesterday guys." I was a very charismatic kid. Probably the most agreeable guy in school, the friends with everyone type, so everyone actually went along with it. It's a play, so everyone who had a 'role' the day before just resumed it and we kept reading. Well, 5-10 minutes later the Vice Principal comes in. He was obviously surprised that we were doing work, but he didn't mention it. He just told us our teacher was dealing with a personal issue and she would be a little while longer. 10-20 minutes more passed and she finally showed up. When she opened the door and saw us there, all reading and paying attention, she burst right into tears of happiness. She died a couple years later from Cancer, way too young. She was only 40. Around the time of her death I found out that was the day she was got her diagnosis/prognosis. So on one of the worst days of her life, our class helped make it just a little better. So, reddit, let's hear your stories.
My friend and I were pulling onto the highway yesterday when suddenly a Mexican looking kid waived us down and ran up to our window. He was carrying a suit case, the big ones like we take on international vacations and it seemed as if he had been walking for a some time. Judging from his appearance I figured he was prob 20-21 years old. He asked us if he could get a ride to "Grayhun". We both looked at each other and understood that he was saying Greyhound, and the only Greyhound bus stop in town was at this gas station a few miles down the road. It was cold and windy out and we had some spare time so we told him to jump in. Initially thoughts run through your head and you wonder... I wonder whats in that suitcase...is he going to put a knife to my neck from behind the seat... kilos of coke from Mexico because this is South Texas?... a chopped up body?...but as we began to drive I saw the sigh of relief through the rear view mirror and realized this kid is just happy for a ride. When we got to the gas station, my friend walked in and double checked everything to make sure it was the right spot but to our surprise the final bus for Houston left for the day. The next bus at 6:00 p.m. was in a town 25 miles over. We tried explaining this to him, I should have payed more attention in the Spanish I and II they forced us to take in High School. The only words I can really say are si and comprende. My friend and I said fuck it lets drop him off, and turned to him and said " listen we are going to eat first making hand gestures showing spoons entering mouth and we will drop you off after" but homeboy was still clueless and kept nodding. We already ordered Chinese food and began driving in that direction and when we got there, he got out of the car and went to the trunk as if the Chinese Restaurant was the bus stop. We tell him to come in and eat something first, leave the suitcase in the car. He is still clueless. When we go in, our food was already ready. We decided to eat there so he could eat as well. When the hostess came over, she looked spanish so I asked her I was like hey listen we picked this guy up from the street, he missed his bus and the next one is 25 miles over can you tell him that after we are done eating we will drop him off its ok no problems... and she was kinda taken by it and laughed, translated it to the guy, and for the next 10 mins all he kept saying was thank you. After we jumped into the car, I turned to him in the back and was like listen its 25 miles, I'm rolling a spliff, do you smoke? He still had no clue, but when we sparked it up, and passed it his way he smoked it like a champ. He had very broken English, but said he was from Ecuador and he was in America looking for a job to make money for his family back home. Like I said he was prob 20-21 years old. Shorly after, we arrived at our destination, and said farewell. Dropped him off at some store where he would have to sit on a bench outside for the next hour.. but I did my best. I hope he made it to wherever he had to go. My man got picked up, fed sweet and sour chicken, smoked a spliff and got a ride to a location 30 mins away. I hope he will do the same for someone else one day.
I've picked up numerous hitchikers but one in particular stands out. His name was Garth. Garth was a hell of dude with a hell of a story. This is the encounter between my friends and Garth. After graduating high school, myself and 4 friends decided to take a long road trip over the summer and Glacier National Park was our Mecca for the trip. We found ourselves camping in the middle of nowhere in the woods of NW Montana, some 25 miles north of Missoula. We camped illegally and got drunk and stoned and pretty much stayed up all night. In the morning, I woke up in the drivers seat of my car to see some dude walking by in the road which was 40 yards away from our campsite. The guy walking couldn't see us just passing by but I could see him. I was still half drunk so I decided to yell at him, not even thinking that it could be the owner of the land that we were illegally camping on. He did a 180 and stared straight at me and began walking towards me. He had a single backpack, a big tree limb for a walking stick and looked exhausted and hungry. He looked like the Big Lebowski mixed with Saul from Pineapple Express but acted like someone who had just had their ass kicked, mentally and physically. He looked like someone had suck his soul out of him. My friends had heard me yelling for him so they had stirred awake to find to their surprise, Garth sitting in one of our lawnchairs eating our stale Doritos like he hadn't eaten anything in days. We would later learn that was actually true.
I admit I had one when he asked me. Back when I was about 13 or 14 my cousin and I were walking out of a restaurant in central Washington. It was late in the evening and already dark. There was a very large river nearby us and I saw a light in the sky that appeared to follow low above the it. Now there was a small airport across the river so I gave it not another thought to being anything other than a plane. But instead of turning left to the airport it suddenly increased in speed and appeared to shoot upwards and quickly across the town. Then it flew off to the right towards a smaller town about 10 miles away. It then stopped and hovered above it for just a few seconds before a smaller light came up from the ground, appeared to hit the first light, and then both zoomed away in the distance. I turned to my cousin and he just looked at me and asked "did you see that too?" To this day is it the only thing I have seen in my life I can not explain. What about the rest of you? What is your weirdest unexplained event in life? EDIT: Well I have learned two things from this. The first was that the guy was right about a lot people having one weird story. The other is that I really should not have tried to read all these replies before bed because now life is terrifying. Some of you have apparently seem some scary shit.
This one isn't quite "supernatural" but it was weird. I live in a very homogenous area. I know everyone on my street and almost everyone in my neighborhood. Everybody is white middle-class. I had recently got a cat, who I loved, but was an idiot of an animal. One day she ran up tree with absolutely no branches and just sat at the top. Would not come down. I live next to a contractor who had helped get her down from another tree, but said he couldn't do anything this time. The tree was too thin and, like I said, no branches until the very top. If I had to estimate I'd say the cat was 20-25ft high. I was pretty upset. I sat there waiting for her until about 2am and then I just had to go home and I passed out on the couch. At 4am I hear really loud knocking on my door. I open it to see a man fully decked out in camo-gear, including light face-paint. He was holding my cat. Here's the conversation we had, almost verbatim. In a thick Russian accent he asks, "is dis yours?!" "How the hell did you get her down?!" "I climb." "That tree had no branches!"
In terms of loopholes, my criminal law professor was also a practicing criminal defense barrister, and he told this story about a case he had won: The event happened in the city of Jervis Bay in Australia, which is notable because it's an annexed part of federal land so that our capital territory can have an active port. My professor's client had gotten into a fight on the beach and, in knee deep water, proceeded to beat the shit out of the guy he was fighting. Assault charges were laid and it went to court. My professor managed to find that, at the time, the delineation of the federal land around Jervis bay ended at the high water mark. Also, at that time, the delineation of the coastal region belonging to the state ended at the low water mark. He managed to show that, because the crime had happened in between these two points, neither the state or federal court had jurisdiction to try the client, and he got off. Obviously the definitions were amended after that so that there would not be such a gap, but that one guy got through.
My favourite are the exploits of Corporal Leo Major, a Canadian scout/sniper in WWII and the Korean War. Highlights (in order of occurrence) Single-handedly captures a German Half-Track vehicle on D-Day. Vehicle turns out to contain important communication gear and code books. Comes across an SS patrol, kills all four, looses an eye in the process, refuses discharge for the injury. Single-handedly takes 93 prisoners at the Battle of the Scheldt. He was offered a DCM for the action but turned it down (wasn't a fan of current leadership). Single-handedly liberates the city of Zwolle. Major and his friend were sent in to recce the town prior to an artillery barrage and assault to come in the morning. After his friend was killed by machine gun fire, Major killed the gunners, took their weapons and entered the city. Over the course of the night, Major killed and captured so many german soldiers, and kicked up such a racket that the german garrison thought they were under attack by a far superior force. By morning, the German Army had retreated from the city. He received his first DCM for the action.
Here is an album of some pictures taken the night it happened and pictures taken this morning in the daylight. The officers tried figuring it out, but none of their guesses brought back any drivers. I live in Virginia, but this happened in a small city that has a university with ~13,000 resident students, so the license could be from any state (or even Canada, I suppose). I have liability insurance on this vehicle. Geico told me that if they can't cover me that I can at least get coverage through the Virginia Uninsured Motorist fund (or something to that effect). My concern is that my back is very screwed up from this (it was a massive jolt). I've had moderate trouble walking, sitting, and moving today because of the pain. My car also started cutting off while driving to where I suddenly lose power steering, breaking, acceleration, etc while driving. Shifting into neutral and starting the engine fixes it for a while, but I only did that enough to get home. TL;DR: Got rear-ended while stopped at a red light and the guy drove off. My car is broken and my back is pretzeled and my only hope to find this hit-and-run class act is to decipher the license plate smudge he left on my bumper. Please help! EDIT 1: Remember that the imprint is backwards from what the license actually says. EDIT 2: The Virginia DMV has an app for trying out different license plate messages, if it helps. It seems to tell you if a license number is available, too. Edit 3: Thank you, to whomever gave me a month of Reddit Gold! Edit 4: Oh, my goodness. I just crawled out of bed and saw that the comment count has risen from 53 to 975! Time to start reading! Thanks, everyone, for looking! Edit 5: crustlessmist figured out the plate number and jwild98 made a convincing graphic showing how that plate number matches up with the impression on my bumper! Following that amazing stuff, the following unexciting update: I attempted to leave a voicemail for the officer on my case, but the voicemail system was not letting me in for some reason, so I called non-emergency and talked to an officer there who offered to give the officer a message for me. I'm going to try later today to call again. With this being a smaller city and it being the weekend, I'm thinking I might not have luck until Monday, but I'll keep trying. Edit 6: No updates from anyone yet. I figured I'd go ahead and put the part number from the pieces I found on the ground here. One of them says: 52127-06050 ITW ^UP TSOP-1G >PP+E/P-T15< R TOYOTA and the other one says ^UP 52128-06050 TSOP-1G >PP+E/P-T15< TOYOTA The "ITW" on the top one looks funny... like it was scratched in by hand. I'm trying to get a picture up, but imgur is having problems. Here is a picture... had trouble focusing with the cellphone. Edit 7: Update: The officer on the case called me and I gave him the information that I've gotten here. He told me that he is actually off this weekend, so he's going to run the tag information on Monday and see if he finds anything. So, I guess I'll have to wait until Monday to learn anything new. I did give the same information to my insurance company, so maybe they'll get back sooner? I don't know. Edit 8: Update: The officer on the case works nights, I believe (I was hit at night), so I don't think he's going to run the plate number until tonight sometime. My insurance company wanted to wait until today to see what the police came up with (although I've let them know about all of the work you guys did, too). I haven't heard anything today. The officer said he would try the plate number and see if anything came back. Obviously, we all know something's going to come back because the report someone ran came back with a VIN number, and I've had some anonymous reports PM'ed to me that point that license back to a town that is only 8 miles away from here, so I'm confident that 5MRTNS is the guy. Now I just need to keep the officers and insurance agents on it. I'll report back once something more significant happens. Edit 9: Didn't hear back from anyone Tuesday. Wanted to give the officer a chance to call me (I believe he works nights) and wanted Geico to get a chance to do their own thing and call me back. I called Geico and the office on my case today around 11am. Left a message with the officer telling him that I'm following up on the lookup he said he was doing, because there's a felon out there and I've been going to the doctor and my car doesn't work, so I'd like to get insurance rolling. I'm going to call again later this afternoon. I think I need to be annoying. Edit 10: I've been calling. Haven't gotten a call back from the police yet, and I can't get the officer on the phone to speak with (only voicemail). Geico let me know that they got the guy's address from the plate number and sent him a letter telling him to contact them. I told them, "He's the offender in a hit and run. What makes you think he'll call you?" My case worker is currently trying to get permission to run a report cross referencing their entire database to see if the guy has been involved in other claims and who his insurance provider is. I feel like they're probably doing what they can. I just left another voicemail for the officer and told him that Geico was able to get the guy's address from their database, so I would assume that he should have been able to as well and to please contact me to let me know what's going on (and gave him 3 different phone numbers he could reach me at). I'm going to keep calling and am considering the current advice of getting the local news involved. Edit 11: I left a voicemail a few days ago with the Investigations Office informing them that I was not getting any calls back from the officer on my case and could someone please let me know what's going on. That night, a Sergeant called me at home and told me he would be leaving messages with the officer and the officer's training officer, letting them know that I need to be contacted. This morning, I finally got a call from the officer, letting me know that they found an address for the plate, but haven't been able to contact the person yet. He said he's hoping to be able to charge the person by this afternoon and that he'll let me know either this evening or tomorrow. Possibly humorous sidenote: He started his message to me (I was at work and he called my house, yay online voicemail) with: "I just wanted to shoot you a message..." the first part of which caught me off guard. :-P Edit 12: The officer called my house again a few minutes ago. He said he served papers to the guy and (according to my wife) said that "the individual" seemed like he was just going to plead guilty and get it handled (of course, speaking to a lawyer may change his mind). The officer said that I probably wouldn't be needed in court unless the guy went for a trial, in which case I'd be subpoenaed, but for now my insurance company should have enough to be able to pursue the guy's insurance. All in all it feels rather anti-climactic.
Hypothetical scenario: An anonymous billionaire is privately funding this. You will never meet them. They are not filming or recording any aspect of this; they simply enjoy knowing they have this kind of power. Each day you are woken up by a man peeing on you. This man has been hired by the billionaire to pee on you. They are regularly checked by doctors to make sure they are healthy and infection-free. Regardless, urine is sterile. Stinky, but harmless. As soon as the pee hits your face (and oh yes, he'll aim for the face) you can jump out of bed and go to the shower. While you are showering the man who pees on you will switch your mattress, put on new sheets and leave $300 in cash on your dining room table. The above situation will happen every single day for the rest of your life until one evening you decide you do not want to be peed on the next morning and cancel. Then it can never start again. Ever. A few conditions: -You may have as much or as little interaction with the man who pees as you want -The man who pees will act as an alarm clock/wake-up call. You can tell him to begin peeing at 6:30am and that's exactly when he will start. -If you share the bed with someone he will be aiming for you. Spashback onto the sleeping partner is a possibility. -If you go on vacation he travels as well. He will typically stay in the hotel room next to yours. The question is: How long would you let this go on? edit: Apparently R.Kelly likes to pee on people edit: To address a common question: Barring a once-in-a-lifetime emergency("My water broke!"), you must be peed on in the morning. This means if you wake up a few moments before your alarm was to go off you must lay there until the first drop of piss hits you. You can have a conversation with the man who pees if you like. Or simply maintain the world's most awkward eye-contact. edit: For any Jack Bauer's out there: Even if you do not have a regular sleeping schedule you must choose a time in a 24 hour period to lay down in bed and allow pee to hit your face.
EDIT: OBLIGATORY WOOOHOOOOOO FRONT PAGE!! Thanks for sharing your stories, and for the kind words as well. I'm not even exaggerating when I say this makes up for my shitty evening with Mr. Revolutionary Lifestyle. So now I just popped open a beer for all of you wonderful people and going through the comments.. I feel almost lucky! Fucking hell, some people are awful!! Hope you've all had better luck since then.. As for myself, I just chalked it up as a lesson.. part of my 'screening' for dating now would include asking the guy if he's into health supplements haha! Really, thanks to all of you.. last night roughly at this time I was moping around after getting home from that 'date'. Now I have countless hilarious stories to read through while drinking and kind messages from you awesome bunch.. worth it! Story-time (warning: wall of text) So I've known this guy for almost a year now, not really good friends or anything, more of casual acquaintances (we have a bunch of common friends and see each other from time to time, parties etc). A couple of months ago he started messaging me, first on Facebook, then by text (he got my number from a friend, he didn't ask me for it) and most of the time I responded just to be polite. He's nice enough, but not really my type.. so when he started dropping hints about 'meeting up', I just turned him down and said I'm busy, or we'd just catch up the next time there's a gathering with our friends, that sort of thing.. Fast-forward to last week and he asked me out again, which IIRC is the 6th time in the past 2 months. I finally decided to at least give him a chance, cos hey what could go wrong anyway, and who knows what I'm missing and all that jazz.. Worst-case scenario it would be awkward, but we've talked more than a few times so I was thinking it can't be that bad and we could actually have a pleasant time. Date night comes and we meet up in the city after work. We have dinner; nice, cutesy Japanese place.. conversation was okay.. I was certain at this point that it's really not going to take off, he really isn't my type.. but I was having a pleasant enough time and he was a total gentleman and not bad to talk to. The bill comes, and I was going to suggest a quick coffee before heading home. However, he said that there's something he'd made an appointment for us for and we need to rush off to make it in time. I was a bit intrigued and excited; was it a movie, or a show, a play (he knows I'm into theater)? So we hurry off and he took me to a high-end luxury mall with an attached wing for offices.. we went up.. wait, this is an office lobby.. what the.. It was a fucking weight-loss center. So he explains that he's part of this company (he works for them on a part-time basis as a distributor) and he wanted to introduce me to their products which would 'revolutionize' my lifestyle and make the healthier I've ever been in my entire life. (FYI I'm 5'5" and 135lbs). I was totally stunned at this point so I was just nodding like an idiot the whole time we were walking inside. He then left me with his smarmy 'teammates', who proceeded to give me an orientation about their company and a run-through of their health supplements (when he got to the part where the weight-loss products are, the smarmiest one said, "Oooh now this is what you've been waiting for, I saved the best for last!") I just sat through it because I knew that if I started to say something, I was definitely going to burst and make a spectacle of myself (there was a seminar ongoing and we were at a little table to the side). After I flat-out said that I'm not interested in any of the products and frankly don't believe that I need health supplements (I eat well and exercise regularly), they started on the 2nd phase: introducing me to the 'business' aspect of it. Basically, it was a networking model of business where you not only sell the products, you also recruit people to sell them and they would be under your 'team', and you get a commission for every sale they make. They rhapsodized about the wonders of the product, how easy it is to sell, and how much money I could be making because they could tell I have the right kind of 'personality' and 'network' for it. Registration was 'only' $1,000, and it was consumable in products.. which I could either use or sell to get my registration money back immediately. I wish I could say I flipped the fucking table and screamed at them to fuck themselves with their health supplements and hope they overdose on their products, but no.. right after the 'talk' I just said I should head home since it was getting a bit late. The guy actually messaged me to say that he had a good time and he hopes to see me again.. and that I would reconsider their products and the 'business opportunity'. I called some friends up and went out for drinks because fuck your health supplements that's why TL;DR Went on a date, guy brought me to weight-loss seminar, tried to sell me $1,000 worth of weight-loss products, and then tried to recruit me to join their networking business.
menthol cross-reacts with and decreases the stimulus threshold for cold-sensitive thermoreceptors. Edit: So some people wanted more information ELI5: menthol is a chemical in mint flavored chewing gum, this chemical is able to activate nerves that normally respond to cold temperatures <20C. That is why when you first chew gum it "feels" cold. They also make those cold sensors more sensitive so now they will start shooting signals to your brain when you drink water even though it isn't <20C; however, your brain only knows that these neurons are saying something is cold in your mouth and that's how it becomes interpreted. Something similar happens when you eat spicy food and it feels "hot" (or if you get pepper sprayed); but in that instance a different chemical called capsaicin interacts with heat sensors. AskScience explanation: Menthol and capsaicin activate different receptors. Specifically, menthol can activate TRPM8 receptor, which is normally activated at temperatures < 20C. Capsaicin, on the other hand, activates the which is normally activated by temperatures > 43C.

This question actually came to me from Mass Effect (can't remember which game in the series, might've been 3). There some dialogue about how universal policy didn't matter as much to humans because of their significantly shorter lifespans compared to other races (I am probably misquoting, but I believe that was the general sentiment). This got me thinking about the following questions: If the average human lifespan was significantly longer (e.g. 200+ years), would our morals, philosophies, choices be different? What kind of effects would it have on our governments, economies, or religions? I guess two different ways one can approach these questions: If humankind had evolved to such a long lifespan thousands to millions of years ago. If in the next decade, significant technology allowed for humans to live much longer. Thoughts? Comments? Edit 1: A good point was made on how the body should age along with the increased lifespan. For the sake of the post, let's assume it's relative. So for example, the amount you would age in one year currently would take three years instead. Of course this is just one viewpoint. This is definitely an open-ended question and am curious what other Redditor's thoughts are. Edit 2: Guys, I go to happy hour and I find myself on front page? I'm not drunk enough to comprehend this! The discussion has been awesome so far and I guess I'm not sleeping tonight because I want to read as many responses as possible! Keep the discussion going!
Just as the title says, I need to do a survey for class. The largest sample size along with proof gets to skip midterms. It can be brand or flavor, I'll sort them out later. Mine is Ben and Jerry's Chocolate Macadamia Nut Edit: The reason I didn't do survey monkey is because we're not allowed to. She however did say I could use social media and other online resources. Edit 2: Holy fuck on a stick. I honestly only expected about 200 replies. There's no way anyone has more than 3000 for a sample size. It'll be a pain in the butt to sort this out. Thankyou for the penis and skunk flavors as well. Don't stop, keep them coming just for curiosity's sake. Edit 3: Oh my god, 14,000 replies I can't thank you enough. Good news: I have the largest sample size and I have bragging rights for the whole semester. Bad news: It's going to be a pain in the butt to sort through all of this and make sense of it. Also my professor said future classes cannot use Facebook, Twitter or Reddit for any future surveys. I've ruined it for all. Last Edit: This is awesome I'm going to have to hire a couple people to read this through. Also if anyone is still reading, I_am_not_a_novelty also has a similar survey. Go ahead and fill that out for them as well http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/KQ9PCPS. There's also now a subreddit dedicated to surveys r/SampleSize. Ask away
I posted this here originally and then this update back in October. Summary: I innocently stumbled across naked pictures of my little sister on the Internet. From advice I received here on Reddit I confronted her about them. I found out after spying on her that the issue was much larger than it first seemed. She ended being put into a mental hospital because of me and I hated myself for that. Okay, so my little sister ("Julie") was in the hospital for almost two months. During that time she refused to see me. My mom, my dad, even two uncles and one aunt? She saw them at visits. But she refused to see me. I was convinced the entire time that the reason she didn't want to see me was that she hated me. I must have re-read my second post about this a hundred times, just to re-enforce my belief that I had done the right thing by telling our dad about the situation. Believe me, the comments in that second post really did sustain me. I've never loved Reddit so much as I have during some of the worst sleepless nights I've gone through, nights where I felt like the shittiest brother ever. Reading your assurances that I had done the right thing really helped me get along through this very difficult time. We were told two weeks ago that she was scheduled to be released on the 21st of December. This had nothing to do with money or insurance (my parents were paying out of pocket for her stay there but cost was never an issue). Apparently she has adjusted well to her new medications and is in much better, more sober state of mind now. I was thrilled to learn she'd be home for Christmas. I dreaded seeing her only because I have not seen her since the "intervention" that led to her being hospitalized in the first place. I was so worried she hated me that I even told my mom, upon hearing the news of her release, that I would gladly crash at my friend's house for a while. My mom's response? "Are you crazy? She wants you to be the one to pick her up!" ... Sorry, I still get teary-eyed when I remember that. So it turns out that the reason my sister didn't want to see me that entire time (two months!) was that she was embarrassed. She didn't mind seeing our parents or our uncles and aunt but she just couldn't handle seeing me. She felt like she'd let me down or something. I drove nearly 2.5 hours out to the hospital last Monday (only the second time I'd ever been there), alone, and greeted her in the reception area. She literally ran over and jumped into my arms when she saw me. I cried like a baby, Reddit, and I'm not embarrassed to admit as much. We talked a ton during the drive home. She has a much firmer grasp on her condition, now, then she did before. Best of all, and Reddit was right about this, she does not hate me for "turning her in". She's healthy. She's safe. She's on medications to deal with her Bipolar disorder. And she actually thanked me for intervening before she did something stupid, like meeting up with that one guy (aka "Asshole"). I worried so much, for so long, for nothing. My little sister still loves me. And I did do the right thing. Thank you, Reddit, for all of your thoughts and comments during this time. I've been feeling miserable for so long, because of all this, but your thoughtful comments and suggestions helped me from going into despair. This is why I love this site. Thank you again. /edit A few things. First, to all of you well-wishers, thank you so much for the kind words and good wishes. They mean so much to me you have no idea. Second, to the anti-meds crowd? Get a job. Sure, meds are sometimes over-prescribed. I won't argue that. But my sister didn't have an "episode" or a "temper tantrum" that was misdiagnosed as Bipolar Type I Disorder. While I'm sure that happens sometimes, you are in absolutely no position to gauge what my sister was going through. You don't know her, but I do, and trust me the girl who was posting those long, crazy messages on those image boards? The girl who confronted me and threatened me with all kinds of crazy nonsense the day after I talked to her? The girl, in short, who was off her medications? That was not my sister. That was my sister in a manic episode. If you have to ask the what the difference is between a manic episode and typical teenage angst/temper, you've never seen one. I hope you never have to, too, because they are scary. Scary scary. Sorry, I didn't mean to go on a tirade about that. It's just... frustrating to read some of the holier-than-thou, "you do realize Bipolar is the ADD of the 2000's, right?" type of messages this post has garnered. So fucking annoying. Go give L. Ron Hubbard some money but STFU on this post, please. Again I'm sorry. The vast majority of the responses here have been so supportive and uplifting, but the few trolls who managed to get a bunch of upmods for being contrarian did sort of piss me off. Done being angry, Reddit. Oh, as for her long term care? She's going to be in IOP (Intensive Out Patient) for the foreseeable future. That means, starting in January, daily visits to a local clinic where she'll receive both group and individual therapy. She's also going to see the psychiatrist she took a huge liking to at the hospital once a month until she finds a new doctor to replace her. She's fine with all this, and is actually excited about it. She has this journal she keeps showing me that she writes in when she starts to feel "unbalanced". She says it's like her own private "group therapy" but she can't wait to be in the real thing again. Our dad took away her computer but he set it up in the living room, right next to the television set, and she's free to use it whenever she wants. She has absolutely no privacy on it but she seems to be okay with that. I think the biggest test will be when she goes back to school. She lost an entire semester because of her hospitalization and she'll be needing to go to summer school to make up for it and while she says she's fine with that, I know it sort of bums her out. Plus, school is usually a "trigger" (so I've noticed) for her bad depressive and manic periods. But I really believe she's ready this time. I've never seen her so strong and resolved to handle her condition as she appears right now. Well, that's it. This is most likely the last ever thing I type using this account. As I mentioned in my original post, I have a real Reddit account that I often use and I simply created this one for this particular issue. I am very glad that I did, too. Reddit came through for me in a big way. I hope that others out there who are in any kind of strange/heart-breaking/etc. type of situation look to this experience and find inspiration to share their own story, whatever it is. The trolls and the assholes try to grind us down but Reddit is good at fighting back. I so fucking love this place. I love you all... yes, even the trolls and the assholes. Adieu, adieu from blind-with-worry. edit the last Okay forgot to mention... as to the Asshole: Believe me, like most of you, I want to go after this prick. I really do. I actually had a huge argument with my father about this about a month ago. When I calmed down, though, I realized that the legal advice he was getting was correct: fanning flames risks spreading fire. What my sister needs now, what our family needs now, is time to heal. Would it feel good to crush that motherfucker? Sure. Would it draw everything out, though? Definitely. That would not be a good thing. Sometimes what feels good is actually bad or at the very least can make a situation worse than it already is. Let me put it like this. Say I posted his Gmail username here. And Reddit went to town crushing him in all sorts of ways. So he decides, "Heck, that bitch ratted on me. I'll show her!" and he ends up reposting the obviously self-shot images to every site and image-board, maybe even here on Reddit. Not only would that humiliate her but it might have legal ramifications for her. What's done is done. Trust me, I know it's a bitter pill to swallow. I'd like nothing better than to meet this asshole someday and do things to him that would get me 20-life in a state prison. But when you think on it logically, what good does that do for my sister? For myself? For my family? As tempting as it is to send his wife an anonymous letter, too, there's just one problem... I don't have his address. In short, I'm just going to have to leave my revenge fantasies to my imagination and Tarantino movies. This asshole/douchebag will likely slit his own throat one of these days anyway. In the meantime, no fanning the flames. Doing so spreads fires. and those are the final words, I swear this time, of blind-with-worry
This is embarrassing and not really recent, but in high school I thought people were saying "heart on" to mean they liked something (like affection comes from the heart). The day I found out people were actually saying "hard on" and it meant an erection was the day I realized I had been telling everyone including adults and teachers that I had an erection for everything. Also adding to my embarrassment is that I'm female. Edit: How I found out that I was mistakenly saying "heart on" to mean "really like": One of my older brother's friends had mentioned that our school really liked 'Brad' because he was a good student. So that evening at the dinner table (with my brother's friend present), I told everybody that the friend said "the school has a heart on for Brad." Everybody got really quiet and glared at my brother's friend. I was very confused and then instantly mortified when my brother explained everything to me after dinner. Also, one very vivid cringe moment I have was telling a room full of people that "I had a heart on for peppermint ice cream."
The barista at my local Starbucks didn't tell me until I handed him my card to pay for the car behind me that 8 of us had done the exact same thing. He and the other workers could not stop smiling! All of them seemed really excited about what they just witnessed, and honestly--I was really stunned that 8 of us had independently decided to pay for the car behind us. After the madness that was Black Friday, and the horrible behavior that usually accompanies it, I just couldn't help but be amazed at what I had inadvertently been a part of. I've paid for people's meals/groceries/coffee before (especially around the holidays), but I've never been on the receiving end of a "pay it forward" chain or somebody that helped keep one going! I know the 8 of us didn't solve any major world crisis this morning or really help anyone out, and the woman behind me may not have actually liked having her drinks purchased by me--but the semi-anonymous gesture of buying your neighbor's coffee on a cold Sunday morning just...moved me. I just couldn't stop smiling. It was as if kindness was contagious this morning! :D And just thinking about a possible "pandemic" of kindness leaves me breathless. I'm sure this isn't even the most impressive "pay it forward" scenario that people have encountered, so I want to hear your tales! Maybe some of us have all been a part of the same chain of kindness. :) Edit: So far it looks like drive-thru cafes and tollbooths are common places for this type of masked-goodwill! haha Though I'm really impressed with how u/Drunkdillweed may have started a pay-it-foward chain at a Little Caesars. Edit 2: Alright, coffee is definitely the current leader in the "thing to anonymously pay for" category haha. I have included a semi-visual explanation of how this can happen in a drive-thru in a later edit bellow! Edit 3.5: (I've added some NEW stories at the end of the list!) While I'm in love with all the coffee stories, here are some hidden gems in case you miss them! Love flows as much as the liquor in this bar tab story; Paying-it-Foward can happen in courthouses too! A little kindness can lead to some judicial magic; kindness is extra sweet in this twist on providing random holiday desserts; apparently car washes are a fantastic place to get a kidness-cycle going; coupons may be good for redeeming a bit of kindness as well; depositing some quarters in a meter may be a great way to drive away some stress in another commuter's day; a toy store worker saw multi-generational magic when humility was anonymously rewarded; book-lover left a prepaid gift card at a register so that the clerk could reward a family that was supportive of a child reading (link coming); and some non-drama filled popcorn is gifted (though not accepted) to a couple of movie-goers. I still really love that idea though!; several "clean cycles" of kindness are being spotted in laundry rooms all over; and these folks caught the ever elusive "kind-crab" during their fishing trip. Most common drive-thru locations for kindness-chains: Starbucks, Tim Hortons, McDonalds, and Taco Bell. Edit 4: I just wanted to do a better explanation for how this entire thing occurred, for those of you who've never seen a drive thru cafe. So, in a typical American drive thru you will pull into a driveway that wraps around your favorite cafe/restaurant. Shortly after pulling into the driveway you will roll up to a giant menu with a microphone and this is where we place our orders. Then you pull up to the window to pay and pick up your beverage/treats. Once you or any other car pulls away from the giant menu, the barista/window worker has the orders totaled up. So, if you notice a long line of cars behind you and you'd like to do something nice for the person behind you, you can tell the worker that you'd like to buy the other driver's order too. No guess work is needed about the amount since it's already been totaled. Hope that clears some stuff up! Edit 5: While I'm still planning on updating the above list to help folks navigate around this incredible thread, this will likely be my last ramble. First, thank you for sharing your wonderful stories! I enjoyed reading all of them. :) Second, thank you to the anonymous gifters for the reddit gold! Now, I know several of you are still critical of this kind of behavior (and I definitely apologize if you've ever been a recipient of one of my errant coffeecup gifts!) and just don't get "the point" of all this. I think the biggest concern is that this type of act conflates helping people in need with giving a superfluous gift to someone who doesn't need it. I never wanted there to be a weighing of the two types of acts, especially since one is obviously more significant than the other, but I don't believe the latter is totally inconsequential... I mean, one can never be 100% sure that the person standing next to you isn't suffering somehow. That they aren't trying to cope with a terrible loss or struggling through a horrible bought of depression. But still, a coffee cup doesn't do any substantial good for those folks either, but it may just brighten their day a bit, which I think does everyone a bit of good. At the worst, it was a free annoyance. What ultimately makes this experience (and others like it) so beautiful for me, and why I think so many others love the concept, is that no one was harmed, nothing was solicited, and the only thing that connected a bunch of strangers for a brief moment in time, was a piece of shared kindness in the form of a cup of coffee. :) These moments are also poignant reminders of just how important it is to give to those who are struggling! If a pre-paid cup of coffee, toll charge, carwash, bar tab, or meal can make such an impact on so many of us, I can't imagine how life changing having someone providing for your actual needs can be. Thank you again for these wonderful stories, and I'll still try to add new/hidden ones to my list above. Take care Reddit!
I've been deaf since birth and there are lot of "sound words" that I read a lot but don't really know what they mean, and dictionary definitions often just refer to other sound words. It's never mattered to me before, but now I'm trying to write a novel with one hearing narrator and every time I use a sound word I'm not sure I'm using it right. I posted awhile ago to r/writing about "scream", "shout" and "yell" but I've generated a list of questions so I thought I should take it to a larger audience. People crying in sadness vs crying out in anger, I know there's some gray area in between where they can be used interchangeably, it's hard to get "shriek" and "ream" are both words that seem to imply emotion more than any specific sound. Is that right? Can any sound be described as "piercing" if it's loud and annoying? Like thunder for example. apparently people use "ejaculates" as a dialogue tag?!?! It seems to mean "to say suddenly or without warning" (or does it just mean "interrupt"?), but the more normal use of "ejaculates" doesn't imply that at all. I don't know if this is a deaf thing or maybe I'm just dense. Does sound have something to do with this? What does "jive" mean? Does "he speaks jive" and "he speaks AAVE" and "he speaks Ebonics" all refer to the same thing? I was raised by black parents but I can't understand any dialogue written in black dialect. I know not all black people talk like that but is there a way to mark that in a novel? Do you know of a webpage that would tell me how to translate dialogue into dialect like that? Are "stammer" and "stutter" synonymous? What about "chat"? Dictionary says "to speak informally" but I feel like it implies something I'm not getting. Is it speaking fast? Can you use "chat" as a dialogue tag? (like "What are you doing tonight?' he chatted"), I don't think I've seen it but the dictionary makes it sound like you can. "mumbling" sometimes implies apathy but other times hostility. Is that right? That's weird because it connotes opposites. What does it sound like? Is it synonymous with whispering? I know cats "meow", dogs "bark" and cows "moo" but what does these words mean when used in other contexts? Sometimes other animals are described with the same sounds, like I think foxes bark which makes sense because they're like dogs but I think I've heard dolphins described as barking too. That's weird. Does a dolphin and a dog really make the same sound? "howl" is just for animals except "howling in pain" right? Is a dog's howl just a long bark or does it sound different? Do different dogs sound different? What if they're the same size and breed? "Chirp" and "squawk" were originally animal noises but are now used in other contexts right? I don't know what they mean really. Birds and mice do them both interchangeably, that's as specific as I know. And I think bats chirp but never squawk? Is there a chart somewhere showing which animals make which sounds? Like, can a weasel growl? What about bears? Bears look like the kind of animal that should "growl" but I feel like I've never seen that written and Google doesn't show a lot of usage. Do all doors creak? Can all doors be slammed? Windows? Does "slam" always imply loudness? Do you always slam doors when you're mad? Do deaf people slam doors when they're mad? (I don't think so, but if it's just a function of being mad I might do it and not notice because I'm mad). People say "he slammed that beer" to mean chugged, that's silent right? Or does it mean "gurgle" in that sense? "Gurgle" is another hard one. And "gargle", that means something different right? "Ring", like "ringtone" is hard to get. What else "rings"? Cell phones sound different from landlines, right? People sometimes describe them as "chirping"? Dictionary says "click" is "A short, sharp sound as of a switch being operated or of two hard objects coming quickly into contact." but I feel like I've seen it in other uses, it's hard to remember exactly what I'm thinking of. But could I use it to describe cymbals, pennies or pencils hitting each other? If a voice is described as "tender", what does that mean? "moan" can be painful or sexy right? Anything else? Is it possible to moan joyously or humorously? "cooing" What is that? Is there a difference between a woman "moaning sexy" and "cooing sexy"? Apparently it's possible to "whisper" loudly and "shout" softly? WTF!? Thanks for answering any questions you can! Edit: Thanks, people are answering too quick for me to really read them all, I'm trying to answer questions though. I'll look over answers more thoroughly as I'm trying to write my book, I'll look at your responses to make sure I'm using my words right. So I may respond to you weeks or months from now.
I'm a TOEFL teacher, and so I actually have (some) training in making these sorts of abstract concepts approachable through simple explanations. I'll try: People crying in sadness vs crying out in anger, I know there's some gray area in between where they can be used interchangeably, it's hard to get People crying "sadness" is like looking at river rapids. It's a flow of emotion and grief. People crying out in anger is like a sheet of ice cracking apart suddenly. It's sharp and sudden. "shriek" and "[sc]ream" are both words that seem to imply emotion more than any specific sound. Is that right? Shriek is more painful (like a pin in your skin). Scream is more broad, like a scratch of a claw. Both imply the same general emotion of horror, usually sudden. Can any sound be described as "piercing" if it's loud and annoying? Like thunder for example. Thunder isn't piercing. Distant thunder is like a heavy blanket, or the feeling of a lead blanket when you get an x-ray -- if the thunder is very close it's like someone throwing a lead blanket on you and then punching you in the face. "Piercing" is like a fast thin dagger in your head or a dentist drill (it comes from "pierce" as in "pierce the skin")
our company had a corporate apartment we used mostly for out of town clients when they came in for meetings. i usually handled the maintenance of it: monitoring the cleaning service, setting up fresh flowers, fruit basket etc. for whenever it was going to be used. eventually i got promoted & assigned those duties to my new assistant. one day she called in sick, so when i found out a client was in town last minute i offered him the apartment for the night, and met him there to show him where everything was since he'd never stayed there before. imagine my (and his) surprise when i opened the front door to find my assistant and her boyfriend (?) engaging in a little friendly game of oral sex on the living room carpet. after i slammed the door shut and hurriedly got him in a cab to a hotel, i went back to work and listened to my voicemail. she had called to apologize for having lied about being sick. no apologies about the live sex show we'd just witnessed. just "sorry, i wasn't really sick, i just wanted a day off'. needless to say, that was the first of many days off for her.
My kids just found a little penguin on our beach! We have called the local environmental agencies, but they will only be here tomorrow. The poor little thing does not seem to be doing well. Is there anything we can do until tomorrow? The kids just named him Gunter :-) I am in the extreme south of the state of Bahia in Brazil. It is very rare to find penguins this up north, but this week alone, 3 washed up on the beaches. This is the first one that is alive. We are in a very small town, far away from any major cities, so there are no zoos or vets who can help around here. The people we called were not much help (it was the end of the day and the specialists were not in) but we were told that they will come by tomorrow. I would just like to know if any biologist here knew if there is anything we can do to help keep him comfortable (and alive) until tomorrow. Anything we can give it to eat? Where would he be most comfortable - in a cool place or not? He is not getting up, but he is moving a lot more now. EDIT 1 - Picture 1 and Picture 2. Yes, it is real Bath 1 and Bath 2. Video of Gunter when we found him EDIT 2 - Gunter made it through the night!!! He is resting in his towels, and was following me around curiously with his little head when I walked in to check on him. He is sooooooo cute!! We checked him for dehydration and to see if his temperature was ok (as per instruction of a biologist specialized in penguins) and he seemed just fine). He drank and also ate a little. I called the people who will come and pick him up, and the good news is that instead of keeping him the small center until they had more animals for the trip, they will try to drive him off today to the really big center 4 hours north!! I will take more pics before Gunter goes, and ask the people in the center to keep me updated. Thank you all for the help!!! EDIT 3 - Gunter does not seem to be doing well at all!! :-( :-( He is not responding to when we walk in, and when we touch him, he does not move his head much. He is sleeping and his eyes are closed, but he is breathing heavily. I think he is dying... :-( :-( ARGH!! And they called saying they won't be here until the afternoon. It will be too late!! I did not want him to die here :-( EDIT 4- Well, maybe he was just sleeping really deeply? Because he woke up and ate TWO live little fish!! He was not interested with the dead stuff yesterday, but he gobbled up the live fish! He also had water! I am afraid to hope, but how can I help it? Fight Gunter!! EDIT 5- They called again, and should be here soon. A picture of my youngest and Gunter and a picture of Gunter chilling Arrive already, Mrs. Biologist! UPDATE HERE
I take care of penguins and sea birds for a living. Give the penguin access to an area with a heat lamp. Keep quiet and leave it alone if you can. Purchase some local small bait fish, this is a juvenile but should be able to eat any small, raw bait fish that are not wider than the width of its neck. These penguins do well in warm climates, but access to COLD water (~40 degrees Farenheit) is good IF it is deep enough. If you don't have access to anything deeper than what the pictures show, don't worry about swimming him/her unless their feet get hot. If the penguin's feet are HOT, than he is overheating and needs cold water to lower his body temp. They should be warm, but not hot. If it will not eat, do not attempt to force feed him without knowing what you are doing. You could easily feed into their breathing tube if you are not trained. Best of luck. Don't get too attached. EDIT: 40 F should be the minimum temp, excellent for rapidly cooling an overheating penguin or alcid. Hopefully trained animal care workers have gotten to Gunter by now (8/15/12)!
Alright, my GF whom I live with, ( A redditor as well if it matters ) walked in on me while i was having a little five on one time and she immediately walked out after seeing me in an awkwardly wrench like position ( You guys know how it is, literally 2 seconds before you're about to clear the snorkel and you dont want to get it on anything in front of you, so you make a little 37.32 degree turn to the left ((or right))) Ok so, she walks out.. and like the guy that I am, I finish saying goodbye to the colonel of love, and continue browsing the web like it's no big deal... right ? I start hearing SOBBING outside the door, I go outside and she goes OFF on me. She goes APE SHIT, "how could you do that, that's disgusting, thats not normal, you have a fucking gf, why do you do this to me, do you not love me, am I not attractive anymore, do you want me to be some porn slut"? She then left the apartment, and I have not heard from her yet ( it's been 7 hours ). I love my gf dearly, but i'm not sure what just happened.... Is it really that big of a deal ? Like, am I a douche for wanting some self diddling time ? WTF DO I DO REDDIT, I'm afraid when she comes back I wont be able to say anything to say, should I apologize ? Say it'll never happen again ? HELP ME REDDIT EDIT Please don't make this a front page post, my gf is a redditor too. I just wanted some quick answers. EDIT2 She called me, was sobbing a little. I told her we "need to talk" She said "ya" and said she'll be home in a couple of hours, shes with her mom ( IS SHE GOING TO TELL HER ? ) EDIT 3 I just received a text from her "my mom is coming over with me, clean up a little.." I'm leaving going to a friends house, I do NOT want to deal with that if she told her. ( I smoked a little to calm down, and I don't think I'm ready for a parental confrontation ) EDIT 4 I'm at my friends house now, and you guys made this front page... wow FU. Ok to clear some things up though between us, We have an AMAZING relationship, we NEVER argue, we have fun together just her and I. I love this girl to death, I hate seeing her unhappy. To clarify "our sex life is amazing"; Whenever she's in the mood, I'm down. And yes there are times when I'm in the mood and she's not that I give her the space needed. This is normal though ? Guys do generally want it more then women ? It doesn't bother me, and we've been together for about a year and a half, and I have Waxed the Winnebago before but she has NEVER caught me. This is actually the first time I've ever been caught. And Ashley, since I know you'll read this: ILY, I know you'll hate me for doing this, but please read some of these comments. I'm sorry that you felt it inappropriate and im sorry for not talking to you about it, ever. I think you're the most amazing girl in the world.. and again, i'm sorry. EDIT 5 She read this, the stupidest shit gets to the front knews, so now I have to go over there. Today r/gonewild/ gets me in trouble, then reddit finishes me with a front page fatality. EDIT 6 Guys, the whole "FU , reddit getting me in trouble, stuff is not serious. I just say stuff like that to lighten the topic, I'm saying it sarcastically. I love reddit, and agree with most of you. I understand she's overreacting, which is why I am going to talk to her, but you guys need to understand as well that it's someone I care about. Someone I care about felt hurt due to something I did. Sure it might have been an overreaction, nonetheless someone I care about felt hurt. Also, I'm not apologizing for making the cyclops fight a 5 headed monster, I'm apologizing to her for posting it here. ( Even though logically to you guys it's a story, you don't know us so it shouldn't really bother her because it's not like I'm going to my moms house....Pun intended. Also, this conversation just has never really been brought up personally between us. I never thought about bringing it up because I've seen it normal since i was 10 years old. And she just never brought it up either. I am 25 years old, she is 23. EDIT 7 I have not read all of the comments posted, to many for me to keep track of, but I know It pisses me off when I read a story that is happening, and the author doesn't update it, so i'll do my best to update it and keep it private at the same time. So, I go home, unlock the door, try to open it. The little chain is on the door. Her mom comes towards the door and says hi with the stupidest, smuggiest look I have ever seen in my life. ( Her mom never liked me to begin with ) and says "that's disgusting" straight away, and walks away from the door, leaving the fucking chain in. I'm not the kind of guy to lose my temper, specially when it's regarding women, but me and her mom have never had good blood between us so the way she said it pushed me over the edge I guess.... Well anyways, she walks away and I kick the door and break the stupid little chain and I told her in a louder then average voice that it wasn't her fucking business, and I needed to talk to her daughter in private... ( to clear things up between us ), sooooooooo she gets her bag, calls Ashley over and she calls me an aggressive sex deviant. Then she tells Ashley " we're leaving " and I look at Ashley, then ask her if she's actually going to let things get to this point over nothing, after everything we've been through. She say's "you didn't have to kick the door open like that Dom, you need some time to calm down " and they leave. And that's where I now draw the line. I'm done with this, you, and your mom Ashley. I've done nothing but be nice to you, treat you with respect, ALWAYS go out of my way to make, and keep you happy. You should honestly let her read this thread so she can realize what a fucking CUNT she is. Tell her to stop using the fucking tanning bed because her skin looks like the leather off of an Alligators asshole. I kicked the door open because it's MY FUCKING APARTMENT. Honestly I'm glad you caught me making my baldie puke, because if it wasn't for this I wouldn't have realized how much like your mother you are. My phone is OFF, don't call, or text me. I'm going to SMOKE AND MASTURBATE ALL NIGHT. PRE-8 Update For all of you who say this is fake, I would like to help you guys out. Tomorrow morning I'll take pictures of the door incident and post them here as update 8. I still have my phone off, so no updates on her. I haven't even touched gtalk or msn either. Now, I would also like to say that if she does message me tomorrow, I am definately going to consider what she has to say, because we have been together for a long time and I have never seen this side of her, shes still someone special to me. As mad as I may get those kinds of things don't change overnight. But don't get me wrong, if she tries to defend any of her actions I will, as you guys say, masturbate on her things, while looking directly in her eyes,** like a boss**. (joke) Maybe she will realize it was an extreme over reaction and come to her senses. If not honestly the thought of being single is not that bad of a thing. Good night for now redditors, and reddettes. Thanks for everything, if this post is still going in the morning i'll make sure to post an update on the situation. If it gets boring i'll just leave it be. Update 8, and probably the last update I did as planned last night, even though I felt like shit about it. It hit me that I could seriously lose someone I care about, over something miniscule.. It's just eating at me, even though YES I know she's at fault, she may be immature, she's over reacting, she's socially uneducated about the general populations ( including my own ) beliefs in certain things, but she's also an amazing talker/listener, fun person to be around, she's smart, witty , and i'll stop now before this gets too stupid. So yea, I turned my phone on, and there were 5 messages. The first two we're "we need to talk please call me " the other two were "call me now Dom I'm serious " and the last one stated that if I can so easily turn my phone off and vent about our relationship on reddit instead of talking to her then we need to take some time apart to re-evaluate things. ( Now I know most of you will say "See, you shouldn't have been immature and turned your phone off" but the truth is, had I not done that I would have said things I probably would have regretted, she may have as well in return. I wanted to wait for me to calm down before talking to her.... evidently that was a mistake, and now she will be coming over on Saturday to pick up some of her stuff with her mother. Maybe it's for the best, and maybe you guys are right and I did dodge an emotional trainwreck of a bullet ( which I still find hard to believe due to how our relationship was prior to this incident ) but it still feels like SHIT. It feels like theres a blender inside of me. This is it Reddit, you have just witnessed a relationship go to hell due to an overly obsesed piece of shit mother who will ruin her daughters life if she doesn't realize what she's doing. I feel helpless right now... I'm still kind of like "wtf... ?" I'm tempted to publicize her mothers contact information so that you guys can have a go at it. But after reading some of the comments left here, I will indeed take the high road and let it be. No work today, and i'm single.. So I'll just smoke away my stupidity of feeling bad and play the 2 shitty games I have on steam ( CS and CS:S I think ? ) :/. IF any of you redditors would like to join me in steam, don't hesitate to add me if you don't mind playing shitty games to pass time, my steam account name is; Fjufju And I bid you farewell, from this post at least. I'll always be amongst you redditors upvoting and spending 69 sleep hours a week on reddit. Thanks for everything, the insightful posts, the comments that made me laugh, and even the harsh-reality posters. I guess I need to open my eyes. One last time, for reddit. LIKE A BOSS but life's a bitch

Regarding missing information.... I do not know what happened I messaged mods about it a few hours ago when 1/2 my post disappeared along with 2000 comments...... I just woke up from a nap and checked my phone, luckily my browser still had the page open so starting now I am going to start transcribing the info from the phone to the post. DONE. Everything reposted. So I may just be paranoid.... but I came home last night after being gone all day to find my exterior garage door keypad was left open, my remote then would not close the garage door, the garage door remote when I clicked the close button would just flash the light on the garage door opener three times. The door did close when I pressed the wall opener. Now this alone is not that big of a deal, weird stuff happens with electronics. But then my mind started racing with all of these things that have happened over the years so I started thinking about those things and went to investigate around my Town House. I present to you my list of evidence to you, convince me I am crazy or tell me I’m not. Regardless give me some ideas on how to test if there is someone in the attic. I have never been in the attic, I tried to open it once.... I had a step ladder and I could not get enough leverage to lift it up, it seemed stuck so I just put the box in my extra bedroom. I investigated the attic entrance last night and noticed 3 scuff marks on the wall, a finger print on the door below the attic entrance (There was also a fair amount of dust that had dropped from the attic entrance onto the door that is where the fingerprints were. I have never noticed anything out or place or food or drink missing. The only exception to this is the door knob on the door that goes out to the garage. I noticed on day that it was coming apart. I had assumed that I had simply slammed the door while leaving and broke it myself but I have no recollection of anything like that. Yesterday when I come home the door handle looked more broken. I rarely lock this door. Twice that I can think of I have heard a loud noise upstairs, when this happened I slowly found a big knife and went upstairs to look around, each time something had fallen down, a closet door once, and some boxes the other time I live alone, and work crazy hours. Often 7 AM to 10 PM and another 8 hour days on weekends (I love my job) So there is plenty of time for a person to exit and enter the house. I never did a home inspection when I purchased the property because of time constraints with a tax credit. As such since the last person moved out the attic has never be accessed.... Speaking of the previous resident. The property was a short sale..... and was being rented to someone for $100 a month. When I went on a tour of the house the house simply had a sleeping bag and some clothes in a bedroom......... I have lived here for 1.5 years. Holy shit I think my have just convinced myself, but I feel crazy calling the cops cause all of the evidence can be explained in one way or another. But there is no way in hell I am knocking on the attic door. What can I do to prove someone is in my attic? I just ordered a Wireless IP camera system but it will not be here to Tuesday. Edit: Uploaded Pictures of Attic, Door Knob, Scuff Marks, Finger Prints in dust http://imgur.com/a/6eL5h#1 Update #1 Just called the Cops, So yeah....... This is either going to make me feel like an idiot or make me freak out cause someone is living in my attic Update #2 Well this sucks. I only own a step ladder. As such the Deputies listened to my story, stood on the step ladder and could not climb into the attic....... Then they told me its probably nothing and suggested I replace the locks, reset the garage keypad entry, and put tape on the attic door or nail it shut. So...... I guess I am where I started........ but feeling more like an idiot. The deputies did appear to understand my concern that was nice. Now to tape the shit out of that door, close the door the bedroom, and build a fort of boxes in front of the door. And I guess I am borrowing a ladder from work tomorrow. Update #3 1:19 AM ----- I finally went back up stairs, taped the door, closed the door to the room where the attic entrance is, taped that door, and positioned a bunch of heavy stuff that will fall if they open it. I am not trying to trap the person in, I just want to know if they left. I also setup a USB webcam on my computer downstairs that will record to a online location if it detects movement. I also deactivated the keypad on the garage door. I am now going to my workplace, I will be returning after work, with a ladder and coworker with a handgun, and a tripod with a videocamera and a led strip to provide lighting. **Update #4 2:07 AM ----- I am now at work, in my locked office, with the door looked and the building security system on and honestly kinda still freaked out about this whole thing. I'm going to try and get some sleep......... ** ** Update #5 12:07 PM ----- I am at work right now, but since so many people are asking for an update..... I got here at work and sat in my office locked with the security system on and I was honestly still freaked out and could not sleep. I took that time to get a tripod setup with a flashlight and video camera so I can look up there without having to put myself in much danger. I am going home early today so expect the next update to be around 6 PM CST. ** ** Update #6 5:33 PM ---- Going upstairs to check this out. Update #7 6:12 PM CST (Sorry for not including this before). I headed up stairs with a ladder and camera attached to a tripod and light attached. I was honestly too embarrassed to ask a co-worker to come and help me look so I took the advice of my fellow Redditor's and I manned up. I went up stairs and used the ladder to move the hatch, and then I used the camera to look up there without having to stick my head up there. And....... There was nothing I climbed up the ladder and had to stand on the 2nd to the top rung to see over the ledge(I'm 6 foot 2 inches tall).......... And there was nothing. So end of the story is there is no one in my attic. Would I have done anything different if I could redo this entire experience? YES. I tell people all of the time to stop letting fear hold you back and cause you to be inactive. So why did I not just act? Call the cops earlier? Get a ladder sooner? Find a Camera? Do something but give in to my fear........ Thank you Reddit for your jokes, your distractions, your honest advice, and your motivational rudeness. I think in some way, shape, or form I needed all of it. As my Thank You to each one of you I promise to read each and every comment and take them to heart, but even more so I promise to be a man of action, not inaction.

Years back I used to visit a website where people would occasionally post little small fiction pieces. Short stories, or poetry or even songs, even though that wasn't the purpose of the site. This one kid of seventeen would post these comedy zombie stories, and while the melodramatic horseshit posted by prominent users would have endless comments of adulation and love, this kids stories went unnoticed except by me. I would always post a little comment to let him know someone appreciated it. Others started commenting in time, but he would always send me a PM letting me know he posted one, and thanks for reading when no one else did. In time I began to get busy with life. I found a job I hated but paid exceptionally well. More I worked, more I earned. I also met my now wife. I stopped commenting. I still got the PMs, but generally either ignored them, or replied with a thanks for letting me know. Read the ones I missed soon. One day I log on to the site after about a two week absence. In my inbox is a message from the kid that's unusually plaintive. Asking if please could I please read the latest story, as it might be his last and he'd appreciate the feedback, and if he didn't see me, thanks for reading it meant a lot to him. I ignored it, and didn't log back on for another good while. Eventually I log in one weekend, and think fuck it, ill read and stop being a dick. So I read them all and enjoy them immensely (they were genuinely good). So I PM the kid, letting them know how good they are, and keep writing. I don't hear back. Couple days go by, and I see someone he spoke to on the site chatroom and ask if anyone's seen the kid. There's one of those chatroom pauses where it goes from lines and lines of new text to stop. I get a private chat pop up with a Link to a post. I read through and its a post by the kids mum on his account saying he passed away a few days ago in his sleep after succumbing to cancer. I suddenly remember a while back he posted saying that his cancer had returned, but he was doing okay, but at that point he hadn't posted any stories, and he was just another username to me. I felt shit. I still feel shit. I still don't watch zombie things because it reminds me of how if I'd have spared an hour I'd have probably made one of that kids last days.

Title pretty much says it all. My mom slipped and it looks like her ankle is broken. I got there to help, pulled my car into his driveway to back it up next to her on the street, and he came out and yelled at us. My mom told him that I'm her son and she called me to help, and he just kept yelling about how he saw us from his roof(?) and wondering what I was doing using his driveway. After that, we just decided to ignore him, since we had bigger problems to deal with. But, in my mind, I was just thinking "Why does it matter who I am or why I pulled into your driveway? You can see her on the ground, you can hear her screaming in pain, does it really matter right now? What the fuck is wrong with you?" If anyone's actually interested, I'll update when I know anything more, but she's just at the ER right now with my dad, I expect she'll just come back with a cast on her ankle, nothing too out of the ordinary. Any interesting stories from reddit about people being just downright idiots about things that don't matter? Edit: My mom just called me telling me to go take a picture of the ice patch she slipped on. I think he's gonna be paying Edit 2: Her ankle was broken in 3 places, and she's going into surgery. She won't be home today, unfortunately. Edit 3: I never said she was going to sue, I am inferring that. Don't freak out about it, if she does sue, I'll let you know Edit 4: Since I just got back from classes and stopping at the hospital to see my mom (she'll be fine, btw) I can finally show you pictures of the sidewalk. Yes, it was actually more watery than icy. And, remember, these pictures are taken at extreme angles so that the sky reflects off of the sidewalk. From a normal, walking point of view, it just looks like darkened sidewalk that just had snow shoveled off of it. http://imgur.com/a/VZRH2 Edit 5: just to make it a little more personal, http://imgur.com/BwgNc she got out of surgery and will be home today. She had a plate and some screws put it, and will have a cast on for at least 6 weeks, after which I expect a brace for some months, all of which will be without her driving.
I was in the car with my grandma on a large four lane road in town. A car next to us side swiped us, pretty hard actually, so we pulled over to do the whole information exchange thing. The woman in the other car leaps out and starts screaming at my grandma saying, "you are the rudest person I've ever seen! You wouldn't let me over! I had my blinker on!" I was completely taken aback. My grandma is the sweetest old lady and had either of us actually SEEN her blinker I know gram would let her over. But there was heavy traffic and her car was directly beside us! I dealt with the beast in the Camry and got her insurance. She ended by saying, "this isn't my fault that woman should let people over." I laughed, which took her aback. I said, "You're 100% at fault here. And by the way, a blinker is NOT a yield sign even if we had seen it. Learn how to drive before you hurt or kill someone." Then we left. I was pretty happy when gram told me her insurance had accepted liability and the agent told her something to the effect of "yes she yells at us too."
Passengers on a plane are waiting for the flight to leave. The entrance opens, and two men walk up the aisle, dressed in pilot uniforms. Both are wearing dark glasses. One is using a seeing-eye dog, and the other is tapping his way up the aisle with a cane. Nervous laughter spreads through the cabin, but the men enter the cockpit, the door closes, and the engines start. The passengers begin glancing nervously, searching for some sign that this is just a little practical joke. None is forthcoming. The plane moves faster and faster down the runway, and people at the windows realize that they're headed straight for the water at the edge of the airport. As it begins to look as though the plane will never take off, that it will plow into the water, screams of panic fill the cabin. But at that moment, the plane lifts smoothly into the air. Up in the cockpit, the co-pilot turns to the pilot and says, "You know, Bob, one of these days, they're going to scream too late, and we're all gonna die." EDIT: I'm supposed to say something about the front page now
There have been a lot of posts from folks who got tired of a day job and decided to go into business for themselves. Let's hear your stories and any reflections or advice you might have after going through the process. Edit: Well this got a lot bigger than expected.

Here's the story, and we're collecting info on our website, too. Sesame Street debuted 42 years ago today. But like most other TV shows, we had a test pilot. We created it in the summer of 1969, just a few months before the first episode aired. The actor who played Gordon on the show, pictured on the above-linked page (or if you that page goes down, here's an imgur link, was replaced by an actor named Matt Robinson (who, by the way, is Holly Robinson Peete's father). Two years ago, we put together a huge anthology of our then-40 year history... and realized that we do not know who played Gordon in the test pilot. We've asked everyone we could think of -- actors, actresses, and puppeteers who have been on the show since its inception; Sesame Workshop's founder, Joan Ganz Cooney; and of course, dug through seemingly endless boxes of documents and photos. Any clue would be great, even if it's seemingly esoteric or mundane. You can email it to us at wheresgordon@sesame.org, drop me a message here, or if it doesn't involve someone's personal info, leave it in a comment. Oh, and one other thing: Here's a clip of our mystery Gordon from that test pilot. And yes, Bert and Ernie look a little different than they do nowadays, but then again, Oscar used to be orange. EDIT/UPDATE (9 hours after posting): Right now, we have a lot of potential leads but nothing solid -- basically, it's mostly "this looks like _____" speculation. I'll update this again tomorrow morning ET. EDIT 10 AM ET 11/11/11: Nothing solid yet -- still all speculation. Lots of leads to try, though. Keep ideas coming via email! EDIT 12/9/2011: FOUND!
I definitely would. Right now I find I'm constantly defending myself when people ask why I download all my shows. I personally do it for the convenience of being able to watch them at my leisure. As a consumer, I would happily download a torrent straight from the broadcasting company's site since I know it would be coming from a good source, that it would be high quality and would be helping them pay their bills. Advertisements make the entertainment industry go round, I'm not oblivious to that. I'll happily be pitched to if the companies are willing to meet me and my lifestyle halfway. Chances are, if I'm vegged out on a couch watching a show, most of the time I'm not even going to fastforward through the commercials either. They simply just aren't a big deal to me. The question is, would everybody else download torrents with ads in them for "the good of it" when there would inevitably be alternative options WITHOUT ads? EDIT: For what it's worth, I am in Canada too. With Bell I pay $55 for 65 GB. I'm not sure how that ranks against American downloaders, but it's not the only way Canadians get the raw end of the deal with major broadcasting companies. Most of the streaming sites aren't available in Canada, not Hulu, not NBC, etc. If a Canadian wants to stream a show legitimately they'll have to do so through a Canadian syndicate (like Global TV, in a lot of cases). The stupidity doesn't stop there, though. I, getting excited for the TV season, tried to watch a preview of NBC's Fall lineup from NBC.com but couldn't because I was geographically restricted. How counterintuitive is that? As I said above, they just have to meet viewers halfway...
grandfather picked me up and took me to the mall to get clothes. he waited outside while i went in and got stuff myself. i was extremely agoraphobic. i had a very strong sense of unease at all the people flowing so freely in movement around me. i went to best buy and bought a sony discman that could play mp3's off of cd's (theyd come out since id went in - no ipods or ipod money yet) and picked up my collection of mp3 discs from a friend. had him drop me off at the bus station that evening, got on a bus for 30 hours and left that part of the country forever. too easy to get back into dope if i went back home. started college about 7 days later, graduated 3 years later (aa and an as, nothing 4 year.) been married since 07, started my own business in 08, became a dad to a beautiful little boy in 2010 and i finished 8 years of parole recently with no violations. im a free man now (for reals - you see a lot of these folks talking about just getting out, but theyre still being supervised) and i just applied for my passport. i think id like to travel somewhere outside the US. edit: everyones kind words are greatly appreciated. life has never been better, so glad to be here.
Today is my niece's birthday and she just went to college so I thought I'd get her a laptop for her birthday. Now, I am a student myself but I still want to give her something special. So I searched for a great used laptop , and I found a decent Toshiba Satellite. I sold my PSP and some other things so I can afford it. So there we were at the dinner table opening presents. She opened mine and has this grim look at her face. "This is it? I thought you'd buy me a brand new one" "You know I can't afford it. It's the best I can do." "I want a brand new one, not this. This sucks! Worst present ever!" She then shoved the laptop and box across the table and fell down the floor. I picked it up, and walked out. My cousin tried to stop me, I just said "I would never give her anything again." She even had the nerve to call back and asked for the laptop. Apparently her parents punished her for her behavior and she will now have to buy her own things. No hand-outs or gifts. My friend bought it as a favor. He helped me pick it out, and knows how much I bought for it. The profit was only $10(roughly) What's the most ungrateful thing you see someone do? UPDATE: Niece called this morning, asking for the laptop, because she will need it for college and her parents told her she will never be handed-out stuff while she is in college. No apology yet, only demands. Her brother said I would cave and give it to her. Fuck no, and fuck you niece.
A couple years ago a friend and I were driving across the country in a big moving truck full of my moms furniture. We had been on the road for about 18 hours on the 2nd to last day of the trip and stopped at a rest stop to stretch our legs and use the bathroom. Sitting at the rest stop late at night was an entire family, mom, dad & 2 young kids and their car which was obviously broken or otherwise not working. Feeling like I should try and help I asked the father what was wrong and he told me they had run out of gas and just needed to get to the next town which was about 40 miles away. I couldn't leave the rest stop with that family stranded so my friend and I got back in the truck and drove the 40ish miles to the next town, bought gas & a can and drove all the way back in our huge moving truck. The whole trip back and forth took us about an hour and a half and by the time we got back to the rest stop we were both about to pass out. Well, the family was still there waiting and I hopped out to give them the gas they needed so badly. I handed the can to the father and he looked at me and said "I would rather have the money". This caught me off guard as money wouldn't help them get anywhere but it was then that it dawned on me that he never wanted gas to begin with and probably had some in the car. He was just fishing for cash and using his kids as the bait. I felt really bad for the mom as she was just looking at me the whole time with this expression of "I'm so so sorry". I was at a loss for words since the dad didn't even want the gas we had just drivin for over an hour to get for them. I just set the gas can on the ground, got bak in the truck and left feeling like a giant idiot.
I used to hitchhike quite a bit so when I finally got a car I was always happy to pick up other hitchhikers. For five years I drove through a canyon in the mountains to get to work and back. Over a two year span of driving that canyon I picked up four different hitchhikers who all shared the same name - Mike. Every time I picked up a new Mike I would have a little laugh at the coincidence. The first Mike was just a normal kid who wasn't old enough to drive; the second Mike was a motivational speaker whose car had a flat tire and I drove him to a speaking engagement; the third Mike was leaving a concert at Red Rocks Amphitheater where he had lost track of his friends, a shoe, and was really drunk and having just moved here had no idea where he was; the fourth Mike was a homeless guy who just wanted a ride to the train station. I picked up one of these Mikes in each of the four towns along this canyon: Morrison, Idledale, Kittredge, and Evergreen. I was telling the story to some friends over dinner when someone nonchalantly said, "Oh, you mean the Mike Canyon?" It immediately struck me that the first letter of each town headed up the hill spelled the name MIKE. It freaked me the fuck out and for weeks I was almost convinced that there was some mystical meaning behind the whole thing. A friend of mine convinced me it was just the "improbable actualizing." Haven't seen a hitchhiker since.
Yes, a hundred fucking times yes. My son was born on a Friday and my wife began (what ended up being her last set) chemo therapy on Monday. For 5 weeks my son was in NICU in Galveston and my wife was getting treatmens at MD Anderson. I recieved ZERO time off for paternity leave, was reprimanded several times for punctuality, and had to use up every fucking second of time I had saved up - both sick time and vacation time. To the point that I have just now started to stack up vacation time, 4 years later. Since I had to use all of my time in the first weeks of my son's life, I had no extra time for all of the Dr visits that both he and my late wife needed. She passed away when he was 6 months old and I became a single father, with absolutely no time off saved. I was almost fired for my attendance issues, in fact the day that I turned in my two week notice I was written up again. Now my son's health is fine and I have started to accrue time. By the time he is 8 we should be able to go to DisneyWorldLand.
As a former Blockbuster employee, congratulations on your free movie! Four years ago would put you in juuuuuust before they re-implemented the great big "Fuck You" of Late Fees (again) and since Autosales took anywhere from 31-90 Days (depending on whether your store was a Corporate or Franchise), you most likely dodged a bullet of $29.99 for the movie and a Bajillion bucks in restocking fees for a movie that only three people in your local area gave two damns about and the other two people have their own copy anyway. Most likely what occurred is that when the store did its Going Out of Business inventory, they counted it as a loss, shrugged their shoulders, and gave no more thought to it. Hell, the employees probably made off with more shit than you did. If, however, your account transferred over to another store in your area and Loss Prevention ever decided to pursue the matter of a lost copy of The Blues Brothers, you'll be getting a letter/phone call/knock on the door/horse's severed head in your bed from a Collections department in Bangladesh wanting their $4.99 +applicable state and local taxes and an apology written in the blood of your first-born child.
orig link http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/117wwr/my_dad_abandoned_me_when_i_was_2_and_now_wants_to/ I wrote a message, is this okay to send? I decided I don't want to come off as bitter or angry. But I don't want him to still have hope of some kind of hallmark movie ending either. Dear Jack, I am 24 years old. I am not the little boy who cried when you left. I am a man, with a son and daughter of my own. I've never spent more than a weekend away from them. I am a father and a damned good one. I don't need you anymore. Once, I needed you. When my mom died, I really could have used a dad. I could have used anybody. When she died, there wasn't even anybody there. No one cared about us. I spent three days in that apartment, eating toast and just waiting for her to wake up. And then they called you. Because you were my dad. You were twenty three, young, but not so young really. If you had came and gotten me, you would have had a son. I would have loved you forever. But you didn't. So I went to a bunch of people who didn't love me, but liked the check they got with me. It didn't make them treat me well. I have burn marks on my arm and I still can't spend time in closed in dark spaces after being shut in closets. An afternoon is a long time when you can't count. I didn't count on anybody. I used to pray, the way mom did with me when I was little. But after praying for someone to come and rescue me, long enough, hiding under my bed and praying that my foster dad wouldn't come in and would leave me alone for just one night. Just one night. I stopped believing in most things. I lived in seven different homes from 4-16. And even the decent ones, I was never family. I didn't have real birthdays or christmases. I wasn't allowed to go in the fridge and just get food when I Was hungry. When I was 16 me and my foster dad got in a fight over a ham sandwich. "Boy, what are you doing in our things?". And so, I left. Sixteen, with nobody to call, and 40 bucks. I just walked away with a backpack. Anything could've happened to me. But I made it. I'm a man now. And I don't need you. I don't want you to feel bad. I just want you to know why I can't be your son. I'm 24 and have never been any one's son. I don't know how. And I just don't have it in me. Jackson
This is a great question. I'm not a scientist, but I am a musician, so I can provide a partial answer. Our current system of harmony is based on the overtone series. Almost every instrument that produces a pitch (guitar string, piano string, organ pipe, the human voice) produces a pitch that is really a combination of many pitches. Pitch is in fact just a measure of vibration. As any physicist will tell you, this vibrating body (stop being sexy dammit!) will produce overtones, or additional pitches, at mathematical intervals above the lowest pitch, or what we call the fundamental. You can isolate these partials by playing a 'harmonic' on the guitar or any other string. The easiest one to produced is done so by lightly placing a finger on the string exactly halfway along the length of the string (right above the 12th fret of the guitar). This produces the partial exactly one octave above the fundamental. Here's the thing. The pitches produced get weaker as they get higher up. The strongest is an octave above the fundamental. Then the fifth above that note. Than another octave above the fundamental. Then a note that is almost a major third above that note (it's actually a little sharp. Long explanation involving equal temperament). Now we have a major chord! You can hear this every time you hear a pitch (with the exception of certain synthesizers that don't produce the harmonic series).
Or you could say, September 28th, 1944, because I've seen films and photos from the war that were still dated on United States time (a day behind) as we fought on the other side of the world. So, the true dates we were on Ngesebus was the 28th and 29th of September. See, we made another amphibious assualt from Peleliu to Ngesebus to neutralize that island, as well. After we handed off the rest of the island to the army, there was a film crew right on the beach filming us getting into the amtracs, on our way back to more fighting on Peleliu. When Seymour Levy and I saw the film crew, we broke rank for about a minute and started cutting up for the camera. The dance? It was called "Truckin'" in those days. It was probably the last "fun" moment we had before losing it all forever. I think the film exists because someone claims to have seen it a long time ago. At any rate, the film would be worth a lot to me, to see myself again at 20 years old with a very good pal of mine. I've looked at the Critical Past and various other internets, but I have not found it. Help if you can.

I'm calling it r/explainlikeimfive. This would be a friendly place to ask questions, when Google and Wikipedia still don't make it clear. A place to ask questions that some people might find obvious -- and to do so without fear of being downvoted, made fun of, or ignored. While r/askreddit sometimes has submissions like this, the VAST majority of the subs there are more in the vein of asking for advice like this one or questions that are rhetorical in nature like this one. I want a place specifically for asking the community questions about current events or other topics you'd usually be afraid to ask. A great example of a question here would be: "Can someone explain the deal with the debt ceiling?" A lot of us may have heard a lot about it in recent news, and despite being fairly well-educated, might not really understand the basic concept. Here's a place to get an answer -- OR, show off your knowledge! The number one rule here would be simple: Respect. As a submitter (asker), you need to respect the subreddit by being honest and asking good questions. While there are no "dumb" questions here, please don't waste the space by asking questions that are clearly rhetorical in nature. As a replier (answerer), please remember that no matter how simple the question may seem to YOU, the spirit of this subreddit is for people to come here without fear of being condescended to (despite the catchy name of the subreddit.) All parties should politely contribute to the discussion. All science-related questions would be kindly directed to the awesome folks at r/askscience (from whom I got the inspiration for this idea.) I really think this could be a great place that would enrich our conversations on Reddit as a whole -- and, possibly even our own personal lives as well. This can be an opportunity to really expand your knowledge so that you can have more enriching discussions with the people in your life. That's the whole idea behind r/explainlikeimfive. I'd love to hear feedback, thoughts, and suggestions -- and of course if anyone would like to help me moderate, that would be awesome. Thanks for checking it out! EDIT Wow, thanks for the great response! I'm grateful for all the terrific feedback, and the couple of folks who've offered to help moderate -- we'll need you! ModMail me over at the new subreddit to let me know if you're interested. As per your suggestions, I'll be adding a couple more rules for the sub: No Politics in your answers. DISCUSSION of politics is fine, but the blatant advancement of your political agenda (whatever it may be) is not for r/explainlikeimfive. Any such posts will be STRICTLY filtered. Take it to r/politics, please. No bias. Like the above, there's no real place for this here. This includes religious bias, gender bias, or any other kind of personal bias that detracts from the sole purpose of this subreddit - to spread basic knowledge. These responses will be filtered also. Please, no blatant speculation. It's okay not to be the world's foremost expert on a subject, but please, if you have absolutely no knowledge on the question at hand, please don't guess. The above rules will apply to question-askers, too! Submissions should be tagged something in the subreddit such as (LI5), so we'll know exactly what kind of post we're looking at. I'll be adding more of your suggestions as they roll in. In the meantime, if you do think this is a good idea, please subscribe and maybe fire off a submission if you feel so inclined. Thanks again!
Even when I was 12 and would play out in the woods with my friends he would have me "check in" in person by Sunset. When I did he would always let me keep playing for another hour or two. Later on when I started driving and hanging out with friends he would have me call in by Midnight. I would always hit the phone 15 minutes early (so I could have time to be home by midnight if he didn't answer) and he'd always extend my curfew to 2am. "Just playing Megaman at Bill's, mind if I hang out a little longer?" "Thanks for calling in, be home by 2, no later and don't expect another extension." "No problem" Now that I'm in my 30s I can not possibly be late to an appointment, and when circumstances arise where I'm going to be late I have to call well ahead to let everyone know I'm running late. Its almost a compulsion, but its a trait that has made me extremely reliable in my job and personal life. I totally blame my dad. His rules were very relaxed and he wasn't strict, but when he said he expected me to be home or check in with him by a specific time, he damn well meant it, and every time I did I was rewarded with equal respect. "Ok you got a thing going on, thanks for checking in, finish your thing and then come home." The mutual respect made it work, it made me want to follow his rules. What things have your parents done that have proven to make you a much person later in life?
So I moved to the U.S a few days ago. We were originally supposed to go from Dublin to London, then on to LA where we'd spend two days seeing some sights then head on to Austin, Texas. Our flight from Dublin to London was delayed and we ended up missing our connection. After standing in line in London for about 6 or 7 hours we were put on a flight to Paris leaving the next day and then went on to LA. Our bags were never returned to us and we were told we'd get them in LA. When we arrived in LA we were told they were missing. With the delay we then ended up having to fly out to Austin (our final destination) a few hours later and couldn't do much about it. Finally after 4 days in Austin our bags were finally found and sent to Austin airport. When we arrived to collect them we noticed there was a huge hole in the side of one of them, the one which held our camera equipment. We checked it immediately but everything was gone. The guys at the baggage desk told us it was most likely the TSA who were responsible. We've tried contacting the airlines, but so far we are just being bounced around by all of them because of all of the different airlines we flew with because of all the connections we were on (Aer Lingus, British Airways, Air France and United, plus American Airlines who delivered the bags). We're also trying to get in touch with our insurance company in Ireland but we haven't had any luck with that yet. Even if they do let us make a claim theres no way they'll come close to covering the replacement costs. The biggest problem though is that we are in the U.S on 1 year work visas which require us to get a job asap. Every day without our equipment is a day we can't work. We can't afford to replace it and we just don't know what to do. Is there anything we can do to make this process go faster? Do we have any chance of recovering our stuff? Has anyone else been through this and can offer some advice? Do any redditors who work in the airline industry or with the TSA have any suggestions? Any ideas or suggestions at all would be a huge help. I know it Halloween so I'm not expecting a huge response but we're just really worried since we put all of our savings into this trip and getting ready for it and its turning into a disaster. We just don't know what to do.
Sorry to hear, but a few things to note: The statute of limitations, the time you are allowed to sue, in the US for airline claims can be as little as 1 year. Usually these are 2 years, but don't wait to find out. This is due to international agreements, the Warsaw Convention (1929), and Montreal (1999). They severely limit what you can do. International travel vs US internal travel rules differ, and it doesn't matter which leg you are on; if any leg of the trip is international, the whole thing is counted as international. Make a written complaint to all the airlines involved IMMEDIATELY. It may already be too late. Seriously, call and complain right now, then write and mail the letter. The airline liability limit will be about $1700 per bag. I believe the final airline who had the bag is the one on the hook, unless it can be proven to have happened elsewhere. Don't bother to sue for anything over that, because you will lose. The airline will almost certainly send a representative and get the suit kicked because of Montreal. Did you have travel insurance? You might be able to make a claim against that, or any homeowner/renter insurance if you have back in Ireland.
Original Post Comment Or do you not read as much now, as when you were younger? EDIT ONE My comment got kind of buried, so here it is. I read a ton on my iPad. Mostly Sci-Fi stuff. I just read A Soldiers Duty which was very good. Wool - Omnibus Edditon was probably one the sickest books I've read in a very long time. Both are available in the Kindle and iTunes stores EDIT TWO What book would you recommend? I'm always looking for new books to read. EDIT THREE My all time favorite book is Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah, by Richard Bach. 417 of 538 reviews on Amazon.com are 5 stars. Followed closely by Replay, by Ken Grimwood. Also very highly rated. EDIT FOUR Holy shit, I have A LOT more reading to do now. Thanks everyone for commenting! I've tried to reply to many, but my inbox has been maxed for hours! EDIT FIVE If you haven't been to r/books, check it out. I'm going to go through all of these comments sometime soon and put together a list of all that was recommended to me, and others. I'll post it over in r/books once I'm done!
He has been suspended until the school decides what to do with him. Thank you for your support and emails, but THERE IS NO NEED FOR ANYONE TO EMAIL THE SCHOOL ANY FURTHER!!!! The matter is being taken seriously now, and everything can move a lot quicker if the school isn't being flooded with email and concern. I promise you, action has been taken. Thank you! I am not asking for therapy, but help in gaining momentum. Since the beginning of the school year, I have been harassed both in-person and online by the school's "bully". It is hard to use the word because almost everyone knows and loves him. I tried not to let it get to me, until it escalated. "Go kill yourself. No one would care if you died. Why aren't you dead yet?" This was said to me multiple times online, and in the middle of class. As a teenager dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts, I could not laugh this off. I went straight to the office and demanded to see a vice principal. I was sobbing uncontrollably and visibly a danger to myself, but they just sat me down and had me fill out a form. I called my Dad, who cancelled his flight out-of-town to come be with me. He was furious that he was not called in a situation like this. We had a conference with the vice principal, and we were told there would be consequences if it happened again. It has been months. Multiple people have gone to the office with complaints about his bullying, and absolutely nothing has been done. Not so much as a detention. He is now attacking the leader of our school's GSA, members, and myself through twitter. Curiosity got the best of me, and I decided that I needed to go through his history to get hard evidence. Here are a few gems I found- some submitted by other people. There are actually over 20 screen shots. "Life has its ups, and you have the Downs. Please do us a favor, and fucking drown" -- A poem dedicated to Sarah. "I have AP Lit in the morning. Sarah, if you say a single word, you are getting choked" (I am the only person in the class who will participate in discussions without being forced). "I was to roofie Sarah" "Sarah has a boyfriend and I'm still single? Time to die" "Sarah for biggest slut. Go die" It is hard enough for me to want to be on this planet, and people are taking time out of their day to wish that I would die. I think this has passed what the school can do. They lost my faith when they didn't help everyone else who begged for some sort of relief after me. I live in Anne Arundel County. How can I get my story (and the others') out there so that we can see some real change before it is too late? TL;DR: The bullying isn't worthy of school attention unless I die. Edit: It's not just me. I have screen shots of him saying things about a TON of people who I am sure have no idea it exists. Going to bed for tonight! I will NOT let him stress me out to the point where I miss class. The other girl involved talked to people at PFLAG tonight, and they suggested board of ed. I might show her this page later. Thank you everyone, and I will be back reading your suggestions and updating you on my progress on this yet-to-be-named operation. Edit 1: Front page? It was amazing to wake up to all this support! I'm on my way to a meeting with two other girls who feel equally trapped in this situation. We will have our proof with us, and we are demanding to speak to someone. I will let you know how it goes! Edit 2: HOLY S%&^ YOU GUYS! I get off my bus this morning, and I see an unusual amount of cops around the school. I find the group who was going with me into the office, and we sat in guidance, waiting for the counselor to see us all (There were about six of us). Next thing I know, someone asks me if I'm Sarah. They had been looking for this "Sarah" all morning, and had even called down another girl by the same name. I get taken into one of the counselor's rooms, and a BOOK of these comments is placed in front of me. She tells me that she has gotten a ton of emails, and that the page has been forwarded to several teachers and the principal. I was shocked. Thankfully, she was not upset about the emails, though some of them were a little nasty. I learn that my Principal has been up all night trying to deal with all of the emails she has been getting. Though she seemed a little mad at first, we quickly settled everything. I was taken into a room with the principal, the counselor, and an administrator to share my story again. I printed off every tweet and the cops collected any threatening ones. They might be able to do something about it, which is amazing, because I wasn't expecting it at all. I'm still shocked that many of the school officials were just now learning about this kid, but I know now that they know: every body knows. Nothing can happen immediately, but the process is starting and consequences will happen. I am slightly scared about the possible backlash, but I feel amazing knowing that even if people dislike me for it, I stood up for my own safety. I have a ton of support- both from you guys and my friends. Thank you everyone who sent an email (they kept mentioning some guy from Montana). There is no need anymore to contact the school or the county about this issue. I will be checking in every morning with the counselor, and she will give me a pass to see her if I ever feel like I'm being harassed over the next few days. You guys made this all happen overnight and sped up the process ten-fold! I don't think I can say thank you enough for helping me, and everyone else, finally deal with the school cyber bully. I love you, Reddit!!!
This is a story about my father. I'm awakened by my mom around 1:30 am. "Get up, there's a fire, we have to go outside." she says. I'm freaking out but I don't smell smoke. I assemble outside with my mother and younger brother and sister. Down the street a townhouse in the same row as ours is engulfed in flames. I don't see my father around so I ask my mom. "He went to see if he could help." she says. I can hear the nervousness in her voice, my father is known to be rather bold. The story as it was told to me as an adult goes like this: My father arrives after the fire department and learns that a man is alive inside, possibly lost. The FD won't go in after the man because they do not feel that it is safe yet. My dad is like, "Fuck that." and (clad in only his long-johns) breaks a window and enters the home. He finds the man at the top of the stairs, badly burned and unable to walk. He carries the man down the stairs and out the front door. The firemen treat my dad briefly for smoke inhalation and the cops take a statement. The man he carried from the house died after a week in the hospital, but his family was grateful that he had a chance to say goodbye. The county awarded my dad a plaque and Comcast gave us free cable for a year. He never talks about it and it was so long ago that no one he knows is aware that it ever happened.
Hi everybody, I know you're all getting tired of the modposts, but I have a very important message for everyone in askreddit. Over the past few weeks, there has been a person (I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that there's only one person sick enough in the world to do this) creating new accounts and spamming child pornography in links on askreddit. To the users who have had the misfortune of clicking these links, I want to offer my sincerest apologies. It's not fair to you to be exposed to that, and it's not fucking funny. If you happen to stumble onto one of these links anywhere on reddit, please notify the mods of the subreddit and the administrators, and just be aware that this is happening (i.e. be extra careful when clicking links in askreddit.) Thanks again everyone who has been letting us know and for your patience. Once again, i'm sorry for the excessive modposts. A lot of you have been asking about laws. I can't answer them for sure, but slicklizard posted this article related to the topic. http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/05/08/11602955-viewing-child-porn-on-the-web-legal-in-new-york-state-appeals-court-finds?lite. (I Promise, this isn't CP.) Also for full disclosure, we're all going completely on the honors system with this. If you see it, tell us. We're going to be shooting first and asking questions later on these kinds of links. We know that there's a problem because enough different people have let us know about it, but none of us are actually clicking these links to verify that it's CP. So please just continue to be honest with us about it. I'm sure you all can understand why we wouldn't want to make sure someone isn't lying about this kind of thing. The question was asked if the offenders were using a typical image host. No, they look like they're using uncommon hosting (the last one was imagebanana). I'm seeing a lot of blame going around to 4chan, SA, 9gag and even SRS. There's no reason right now to believe that this is anyone except one individual who needs treatment. Any accusations only serve as meaningless speculation, so let's please not demonize any of these groups. I may not have made this clear enough. Askreddit is not being inundated with child porn. You're not in any more danger today of clicking a CP link in askreddit than you were yesterday. Enjoy participating in askreddit discussions with the understanding that this is a forum open to any amount of people to post things like this. The mods and admins do care and we're doing everything we can to fix the problem.
I'm not that bad yet, but physical ailments and pains hit you more often, harder, and stay with you longer. Time was, if I hurt myself (a sprain here and there) or got sick, it was just a matter of waiting a few days to heal. Nowadays even with medical assistance. it's weeks and weeks of aches and pain before something heals. (cuts and scrapes are ok, but muscles, joints, nerves take forever). It's hard to explain, but you slowly lose the illusion of invulnerability you had in your teens and twenties. Parts of you start hurting for no discernible reason. Doctors stop trying to treat or diagnose you and just say "well you're getting to that age". Losing touch with friends as they get married, have kids, move away, build lives of their own. It gets harder and harder to just hang out. I live in NYC though, your mileage may vary in small towns. Most painful for some (and leading cause of mid-life crises) is the realization that every day your potential is shrinking. The more you live, the more you're locked into that life. One day you look at yourself and say "well, this is it. This is all I'll achieve and be this life." You can either come to terms with it in a healthy way or let it depress you, but it's a very different feeling from the sheer potential you feel when young. Sure, when you were young you knew on some level that your wildest dreams are a long shot, but they COULD happen. That hope dies bit by bit as you age.
There's been a joke floating around Reddit/the Internet for ages where the husband-to-be is asked to come over to the bride's house for a favor. The bride isn't there but the little sister is, little sister tries to seduce him, he runs outside, and the whole family is outside congratulating him on not succumbing to her temptation. The joke being that he keeps his condoms in the car and was just going to get them... Guess what? This shit HAPPENED to me today. My girlfriend calls me over to help her friend (who is definitely not unattractive and I've known quite well for some time) with some computer problem. I show up and the friend tells me the GF ran out to do some quick errands. I ask about the computer and she starts bullshitting about how it's been "running slow" or some other non-point issue. Suddenly, the friend asks if I think she is attractive. I hesitate. Not wanting to upset one of the future bridesmaids I tell her "of course, you're pretty." She then starts telling me all this shit about how she has always had her eye on me, and how nice I was, and how hot I was... I was kind of just floored. After that she fully came on to me. Went for the embrace, tried to convert to kiss. I pulled away, excused myself, and went out the door. Head count: Mom, 3 other friends, my girlfriend, and her sister are outside waiting for me. They all laugh and cheer, the girlfriend runs up and jumps in my arms like I'm some sort of hero, and the mom has tears running down her cheek. They all kept saying how glad they were I "passed the test" and how "good I was" for her, etc. I smiled a bit, was really shaken up. In the middle of all the celebration I quietly said I wasn't feeling well, and excused myself. Got in the car and drove off (small burnout, it's what the Camry could manage), and have been hitting ignore on the countless phone calls I've gotten since then. As of this post (6:13AM PST), it's been about 12 hours since the incident and I still can't place my thoughts. On one hand, I feel deeply and utterly betrayed. On the other, it's ridiculous to the point that it's funny and my girlfriend has never done anything even close to this before. Reddit, talk to me. What are your thoughts? EDIT: (6:50AM PST) Wow, the initial feedback is huge. I guess this struck a chord with many people. I e-mailed her a little note that basically said I needed "some time to think about what happened today." I haven't slept at all so I think I'm going to see if I can get a few hours in and then go from there. Thanks for all the kind words so far.
Be attractive. Don't be unattractive. (thanks earsofglitter) Don't EVER stick your dick in crazy. Masturbate before any moderate life event/decision. If you want something, you have to ask for it.

In high school my girlfriend invited me over to a house she was babysitting at after the kids went to sleep. We were involved in a serious make out session on the parents bed and only partially clothed when they parents came home early. She ran into the bathroom and I jumped into the closet but I realize my pants were still across the room on the other side of the bed. Soon after she came out of the bathroom I heard them thanking her and then the father told her he would drive her home because she didn't have a car. She was terrified and didn't know what to do so she left with him. I found myself semi naked in the parents closet and alone in the house with the mom and the sleeping kids. I was terrified. The closest had the shudder type doors that you could partially see out of so I could see the mom start to get undressed and get ready for bed. It was starting to look like the beginning go a long night that was sure to end in either me being arrested or shot. When it seemed like all hope was lost she went into the bathroom and shut the door. Seeing my opportunity I leaped out of the closest, grabbed my pants and ran out the back door. To this day I don't know why I went out the back door but I did. I crawled over a six foot high block wall and landed in the neighbor's yard still clutching my pants. I had to hop several other walls before I was able to get back to my car and tear out of their like the Dukes of Hazzard.
Hey I am dad of three girls. 10, 9, and 3. My wife, and the love of my life, died giving birth to our third daughter. So far after learning a bit about hair, girls have been easier then boys. Today my second oldest daughter Catherine got her first period. I haven't had to deal with this with my oldest yet. I haven't actually seen her yet I am about to leave work to get her. She had her period in the middle of class and sounded embarrassed on the phone. She is a lot like her mother smart but fairly shy. She is certainly not going to open up to me about this. What do I do? What do I say? If you were a young girl what would you need? I know these are childish questions but maybe I am a little scared and could use any advice. Ok I wrote this in a panic. Any advice appreciated. Wish me luck EDIT::: WOW! i did not expect this level of response. i am honestly really touched. For everybody who wants to know my girl go; Sarah (10), Catherine (9, the lucky lady), and River (3). Their mother died giving birth to River. River is also blind and has slightly underdeveloped lungs, but she is also the best dancer in the family. Catherine took a nap when she got home. i took her out shopping and bought WAY too many brands of pads. we all built a cover fort and ate pizza in it. So far I might be a mess, but my girls are amazing and mature, and quite frankly i want to get older and be like Catherine. She gave more of everybody has their own time talk then me. I want to thank everybody for their advice, kind words, unwarranted compliments, and PM's. Catherine is a currently a Buddhist, I am an atheist but i let them find their own religion. I told her that i got a lot of advice from lots of nice people online. She wanted me to thank you all and wish you peace and happiness and a good nights sleep. I am obviously paraphrasing she is 9. From the bottom of my heart i would like to thank you all so much. I will continue to read and reply as i continue to be clueless.
I teach 4th grade and we learn about "taxation without representation". I used to do an activity where every student brought in 100 pennies. Over the course of a few days, students would have to pay "taxes" on things like using the pencil sharpener, worksheets, using the door, etc. After a few day, I would have a good amount of money in the "tax jar' on my desk. Well, I would empty it and then bring in donuts for myself and the other grade 4 teachers. We would all stand in the hallway in the morning eating the donuts and telling the 4th graders how tasty they were and sarcastically thank them for the donuts that were "paid for with their taxes". So, of course, the students would get really peeved. They would then write their 'declaration of independence" from the 4th grade. We would then celebrate their new freedom with a pizza party at lunch which is where the money would actually be used. I don't do this activity anymore because I had some parents that are too stupid to figure out they chipped in a buck toward a pizza party for the class that I then put in about 20 bucks in to pay for. They went to the school board accusing me of stealing from students and demanded I be fired. So, don't do that one now, but I sure miss those donuts.
When I was four or five years old, there was a girl in my class who had very few friends. My mom always told me to try to make friends with everyone at school, so one day I walked up to her and and asked her if we could be friends. I would play with her on the swings, and sit next to her during class. I remember her being very shy, but a great friend. I had so much fun playing with her, and we would make believe about swinging all the way out into outer space - we even made up a song. One day, suddenly, she stopped coming to school - our teachers told us she moved away to another state. I was sad to know I couldn't see her anymore, but I accepted that she had left. Recently, while talking nostalgically about the past, my mom was able to tell me the truth about what happened to my friend. Her name was Olivia, though we both cannot remember her last name. She attended Dallas International School, and was in the same class as me in pre-K (this must have been circa 1996-1997). I couldn't remember this, but my mom told me that Olivia always came to school in tattered clothing, looking very unkempt. My mom remembers that, when attending birthday parties, her mother would drop her off and only pick up her daughter many hours after the party had ended and all the other children had been picked up. These were little things that the other parents noticed, but that could very easily be concluded as an unfortunate financial situation where the mom worked, and therefore could not pick up her child on time. However, one morning my mom was watching the morning news, and she was shocked to find out that Olivia's mother had murdered her children/family, and then killed herself. Reddit, I know that this happened over a decade ago, but it still deeply, deeply saddens me to find out that my friend died. I tried to research her story online, but I figure there must not be very many reports from the 90's. Also, because these are only my mom's memories, we cannot remember how she killed her children, how many children she had, etc. I know this is an extremely long shot, given how little information there is to work from, but I wanted to try my best to pay my respects to Olivia after all these years. If you could help in any way to figure out what her story is, I would be incredibly grateful! ** EDIT **: Reddit, I cannot thank you enough - within fifteen minutes of posting, Olivia and her story were found thanks to jacques45 and a few other posters several moments later. You have proven to me once again that this is a truly wonderful community, and I am very grateful! I am not sure where to go from here - I feel as though I am mourning a loss many, many years after the fact - though I know I can finally rest knowing that she will never be forgotten. Once again Reddit - thank you! ** EDIT 2 **: 2 hours and this thread has reached the front page of Reddit. I am overwhelmed with emotion, and am so happy that Olivia and her story have incited such a response from this community that never ceases to amaze me. I apologize for my lack of replies - I broke down after reading her story and have sought some immediate solace in the company of very close friends who have made this easier to bear. I will get back to as many of you as I possibly can. Once again Reddit, you are all truly amazing - never forget it!
Jane Hopkins in 1997. Sorry for your loss, even/especially if you weren't aware of it at the time. University Park, TX -- Aug. 2, 1997 -- The discovery of a half dozen suicide notes and the murder weapon has convinced police in this upscale Dallas suburb that Emily Jane Hopkins slashed her children's throats and then her own. The bodies of Ms. Hopkins, 41, her 6-year-old daughter Olivia and her 9-year-old son Clayton were found July 30, by her ex-husband of five years, Clayton Elliott Jr. Elliott told police he was planning to visit the children, when he walked in on the gruesome scene and called 911. "My son has been murdered. My son has been murdered," Elliott told police dispatcher Cathy Marr. "My ex-wife and daughter are missing." Crying, he described finding his son, who he said was stabbed after a struggle. "He is not breathing. He is cold. I can't believe it," Elliott cried as the dispatcher tried to console him. The homicides are the first this year in University Park, which averages about one every three years, police Chief Bob Dixon said. "It is such a tragedy for everyone ... the family, the husband," Dixon said. "We haven't seen anything like this in a long time, if ever." The Dallas County medical examiner's office released a report ruling the deaths a double murder-suicide caused by "multiple sharp-force injuries."
That depends on how cash strapped you are. My partner and I aren't the wealthiest people on the planet but we're not struggling to pay household bills either. We have a joint account which is used to pay for all the essentials but we both have separate accounts into which we pay a small percentage of our combined incomes. Those are ours to do with as we see fit. Sure if I were to develop a gambling problem and start blowing my entire spare income on it, or worse borrowing against that income, then there'd be hell to pay. But within reason we both have the independence to do what we like with the money. For a lot of people even a small amount of independence can be incredibly important. We're both still pulling in the same direction and we both frequently use our own money to pay for things for us both, but we can do so through our own choice rather than because we fear the other person is watching. Not everyone is fortunately enough to have that luxury and often have to pool resources just to make ends meet. But if you can afford to keep even a few tens of pounds / dollars a month in a separate account then the independence can help alleviate the financial strain of completely losing your independence and ability to do even small things unilaterally.
I went on a business trip this weekend and got home at 6:25AM. I didn't want to wake her and the kids, so I sat quietly in the living room watching TV. A few minutes later I get a text from her: "Thanks for staying over babe. I love sleeping next to you." Obviously, I wasn't here last night. I'm still on the couch and haven't responded. I think she went back to sleep and has no idea she accidentally texted me. Monday: I had to go to work before confronting her. I think it was better anyway, since it gave me time to think about what to say instead of rushing to anger. I asked my assistant to go to the 7-11 next door and see if they have Shiner Bock. If they don't, I'll ask him to go as far as Publix. For science! (Edit: we didn't find any) She finally texted me at work, and said that her (girl)friend stayed over. I didn't respond. (3:00PM EST) Tuesday: I left work last night and went to dinner with one of my work partners. I didn't say a word to my wife when I came to bed. In the morning I mentioned the text after I woke up. I told her I was surprised she would use that language with a girlfriend. She broke down and admitted that she had a (platonic) girlfriend AND an (not-so platonic) ex-boyfriend over while I was away. She admitted it wasn't the first time. I calmly told her I would have to think about how I feel about the situation and let her know whether we should seperate. Thanks, reddit, you prepared me for the worst, way in advance. It's nice to get the hivemind's opinion sometimes before jumping into a rash and complicated situation, or acting brash and angry as a reaction. I really appreciate everyone's comments and help figuring out the next steps!
I will stick to the readers digest version of this story because I am at work, but here goes... So a couple years back I noticed my (then) wife started acting strangely at night. She would stay up very late (well after I was already in bed) and had her phone by her side at all times, even going to the bathroom, walking from the living room to the kitchen, etc... This obviously caught my attention because she had never behaved like this in the previous 4 years we had been married. So, I started my investigation by looking at our phone bill to see if she was texting anyone. To my horror, I found hundreds and hundreds of texts being sent to the same number every night, usually beginning around the time I would go to bed. Plus probably 15-20 picture messages per night. I cross referenced the phone number she had been texting and it was nobody that I knew, this eliminates all of her family and any close friends, as I have all of their numbers stored in my phone as well. So my next step is to try to steal her phone and read her text messages. Not easily done since she is watching her phone like a hawk, but a few days later I finally managed to get my hands on it... only to find her entire inbox is completely empty. She is deleting all of her texts throughout the day. What is she hiding? I look in the pictures to see if I can find anything scandalous, but I get the same result: all of her pics are deleted. I put the phone back and plotted my next step.
I travelled 3000 miles to Lima, Peru on a business trip. I had an official escort because that city had a little terror problem, and kidnapping of "visitors" was somewhat common. I wanted to stock up on some snacks for my hotel room so we popped into a grocery store in a random area, totally away from the "nicer" shore area. I grabbed some Skittles or what-have-you and my escort grabbed a drink and a few other things he needed. I went through the checkout first and was standing at the front window, looking out onto this street, admiring the broken bottles lining the walls to all of the house "compounds" when I see a good friend of mine from college walking down the sidewalk. I ran out and yelled his name and we both did the "what are YOU doing here?" exchange. Turned out he was also working there, but for a full year. My escort was like "man, you white people can go anywhere and make friends!" Edit: to clarify about the terror threat: this was 12-13 years ago, the Shining Path terror group was being pushed out of the cities into the jungles around that time. I believe they had made some kind of threats related to GW Bush/Americans, thus the need for an escort, instead of me taking taxis by myself or whatever. Everyday Limans were certainly doing alright for themselves.
Let's try this again... Traditionally suicides skyrocket during November and December. In 2011 they didn't, and I noticed. Then 2012 came along. And people started killing themselves. At the rate of 1 or more per week in my relatively small jurisdiction. Roommates come home to find their roommates hung, boyfriends are shooting themselves in front of girlfriends, an adult brother called the police to tell us to come get his juvenile sister, who was sleeping, after he kills himself. I've cut people down from doorways and performed chest compressions on shooting victims. When I get dispatched to a death, I can't "not click the link." I have to go. I have to go in. I have to see the result. I have to handle the body. I have to talk to the family. I have to hear the screams and hysteria. And I frequently have to bring those images home. People, especially relatively young people, are killing themselves at what I consider an alarming rate. I want it to stop. Please. If you are feeling like you want to hurt yourself reach out to r/suicidewatch. Or call 1-800-784-2433 (1-800-SUICIDE). Or call a loved one. Or reach out to Befrienders. And if you see a friend or loved one in need, give them the support you need. This is my Cake Day wish. Mods told me that like Jeopardy, my post must be in the form of a question. It's rules, as a cop I get that. My question is, what could you do today to prevent someone from killing themselves?
I have a financial planner. He's a dyed-in-the-wool PNAC militant Republican, all the more ironic considering he's an Iraqi with family ties to Chemical Ali. I watched him give a seminar once where in one breathtaking sentence he managed to tie Rosie the Riveter to Osama Bin Laden and blame the rise of Islamic terrorism to the post-war appearance of women in the workplace. I mention this not only to illustrate that his mindset is very much not my own, but to illustrate exactly how far away it is from anything I would consider "progressive." Yet he manages my money. And he manages it aggressively. When we had this come-to-jesus about philosophy he said "I'll tell you the same thing I told (a prominent liberal whose money he also manages). I don't make the laws. I just play by them. You can hate the policies as much as you want but if I leave money on the table, I'm not doing my job. What you do with it is up to you - give everything I save you to Greenpeace for all I care. But can we have an understanding that because the tax code is written for the rich by the rich, you'd be a fool not to play the game by our rules?"
The disparity and total two-facedness of Reddit has made me absolutely sick. We all know about the P-Dub asking for help thread. Everyone donated to the guy who was popular on Reddit simply because he asked people to remind him about doing his homework. We didn't know the full story of what happened with his mom, nor did we wait to see what transpired. No, we donated $7,000 as of 24hours ago because we wanted to help. 21 days ago, a woman who had similarly fallen on hard times, a Redditer for over a year (more than P-Dub, I may add), was thrown into a pit. She also reluctantly posted a Paypal link (which she later removed). She was told to stop having children, Redditers were told to be a "bit more skeptic and not just throwing money at people," and she was called a beggar. Two people came asking for help. One made off with $7,000+ dollars, one got nothing. One got praise, helpful advice, and assistance, one got insulted and called a scammer. Can we just ban e-panhandling altogether? The generosity of Reddit is amazing, but one of two things will happen if this continues: People will become jealous, because someone got superstar treatment and help from Reddit because they were a user people ejaculated over, while other users in similar or worse circumstances who contributed just as much got nothing. People are going to start preying on our generosity in order to potentially make off with some money The best thing we can do when someone has hit hard times is to give them our experience. We can offer words of wisdom as a lawyer, put people in touch with people we know that can help them, and even offer services to these people that they need at no charge. Scammers or unethical people will have no use with specialized help and advice, and the people down on their luck will be thankful for anything they can get. EDIT 1: Just got this from Shannonigans: I know this will be buried if I just post a comment, but I just hoped maybe you could put an edit in there for me. No matter how many people were mean, the kind ones meant way more, I've received several gifts in the mail from redditors. Several stuffed animals, books, and a gift card, not to mention a giftcard to kohls to help. Reddit did about 1/3 of my Christmas shopping for me and the ones that sent kind words meant just as much. Right after my girls open their gifts, there will be a follow up with words of appreciation and recognition and pictures of the Christmas that reddit helped happen. I appreciate being skeptical, but I was really telling my true story. I hold no resentment towards P-Dub at ALL. If I could help right now, I would! For now, a picture of my oldest and I with the card sent in stilesjp's care package of soaps (one of which she will NOT put down) http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v12/Shannonista/CIMG0278.jpg Thank you, reddit, and thank you eggbrain, for caring. All the love in my immediate family goes to all the love for my reddit family. EDIT 1.5: (same time as the previous edit, but wanted to separate thoughts) I'm really glad things worked out for Shannonigans. I was disgusted when I saw her called terrible names (some of which, since this posting, have been deleted.) Unfortunately, this doesn't change the fact that had there not been this topic, no one would have known about her, or any of the other unfortunate stories, some of which have been posted in this thread. I respect the right of individuals to make their own decisions as to whether or not to donate to a particular user. But I also think there is a responsibility of users to not just throw money at situations that they know almost nothing about. I think it also teaches a bad example that someone down on their luck can get an instant solution in the form of cash without working for it (Which is why I think gifts of service and people is much more helpful). Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. Shannonigans had been working 2 jobs and was cutting down on everything in order to make things work. Was P-Dub even at the point where he had exhausted his resources?
I live in the north of Switzerland. We have a lot of old military bunkers from the Second World War. When I was 7 or 8 years old, three friends of mine and I went out to explore one of these bunkers who was built on a hill inside a small forest. The main door was jammed, so we had to break it up. We found a big log nearby and used it as a battering ram. After many tries the door won’t budge. But there was a peephole. It was about 10 cm (4 inch) in diameter. We opened it and illuminated the dark inside. There was a long, ruined and dark hallway with rooms on the left and right side. We couldn’t see the end of the hallway. It was just too long. Every one of us wanted to catch a glimpse of the inside, when one of my friends says: “There is a small light at the end of the hallway”. This light was not there when I watched trough the peephole. So I pushed him away and took a second look. What I saw gave me a shiver. There was not a small light, it looked more like a flashlight pointed directly towards me and behind it was a silhouette of a person. I walked a few steps back and said: “There is someone in there!” At the same moment someone (or something) knocked on the door from the inside of the bunker. This was the moment we got into panic, start screaming and run away. I was so scared I run straight home and locked the door. On the next day in school, my friends and I talked about the event. We came to the explanation that probably some older Kids have played a prank on us. One week later we went to the same bunker again. But as we saw, the welded connection, that should keep the door locked, where rusty and not broken, we just left without saying a word to each other. It was impossible someone opened this door before us, and this was the only entrance. I still life in the same region. But since then I have never visited the bunker again.
When I was a kid we would take long family road trips to Ohio to visit my grandparents. I absolutely loved these trips - my grandparents had all sorts of cool stuff in the house, two big apple trees in the front yard, and they lived next to a train track. My grandpa also loved Golden Grahams. Every time my brothers and I would visit, he would open his cupboard to reveals four or five boxes of Golden Grahams, explaining how much he loved them and that he got some extra boxes just because we were visiting. I always thought it was so cool that my grandpa - who was, you know, old - had the same favorite cereal as me. I would always feast on cereal every time we went to visit. Of course, years after he died, I was relating this story to someone and the obvious dawned on me. Later I asked my mother if grandpa even liked Golden Grahams, and she got this big smile on her face, looked a little sad, and said "No... but he knew you did." Broke my heart. Still the story I tell when I remember him.
The creepy case of the letters. Circleville is a small city in Ohio that has a population of over 13,000. Its biggest event is the annual Circleville Pumpkin Show. It is also the home of a mysterious letter writer known as the Circleville Letter Writer. Starting in 1976 residents of Circleville began receiving mysterious, vindictive letters. Thousands of letters, written in block letters were sent to city officials and even normal citizens. One recipient of the letters was school bus driver Mary Gillespie. She received letters accusing her of having an extra-martial affair with a school official. On August 19, 1977 Mary’s husband Ron Gillispie received a phone call seeming to indicate the identity of the writer. He left his house with his gun to confront the writer. He was found dead a short distance from his house. His car was driven off the road and his gun had been fired once. He died as a result of the crash and it is unknown why he fired the gun. It is unclear if it was an accident or murder. Later, while driving her bus, Mary saw signs along her route harassing her. She went to take one down and discovered a booby-trap meant to fire a gun at her. The gun belonged to her former brother-in-law Paul Freshour. Freshour was convicted of attempted murder and was thought to be the Circleville writer. However, while incarcerated the letters continued despite him being in solitary confinement without access to letter writing material and his mail being monitored. He was denied parole because of the letters and received one himself after his parole was denied.
Not my story but I remember my sister, who is a nurse, telling me and it stuck with me. She had a male patient in his late 80s who only had a few days left. I don't remember exactly what he had but it was a pretty painful disease from what I remember. My sister said that he was always pleasant and would never show a sign of pain until someone left the room. She only knew this because she had to come back in the room for something she forgot and saw him suffering. Anyways, this man had a very loving wife, they had been together for over 60 years. My sister was in the room with both of them and they were laughing and joking around. The man asked his wife to go fetch him a glass of water. My sister offered to get it for him but he refused. He said "She needs to get out of here for a little bit, it is stuffy". His wife agreed and he told her thanks and said how much he loved her. After she left the room the man asked my sister if his wife was gone. When my sister confirmed his wife was indeed gone he said "Let her know she was the best thing that ever happened to me" and he closed his eyes. Within a minute he was gone.
I volunteered at an after-school program sponsored by the local YWCA. The 'false accusation' scenario happened to me. The children consisted of mixed ages from grade 1-6. One girl, may have been in third grade, was mad at me for consistently refusing to play with her. I didn't like to interact with her because my supervisor and the other aides warned me about her. My impression of her led me to believe the warnings were appropriate. She may have had 'something' going on in school or at home that affected her adversely. I don't know. I only saw her three hours a day, twice a week. She was kind of a snotty bitch IMO. But I also reasoned that kids are good-natured and curious. Anything beyond this is generally in response to some stress. Long story short, in an effort to get revenge for my lack of attention she accused me of molestation. She concocted the whole scenario, came out of hiding (during a search) just bawling, scratched herself, the whole deal. At the time of her admission I was at recess with a big group of other kids running around. I was called inside and the situation was laid out. I was completely dumbfounded. I couldn't say or do anything without enabling a scenario of my word against that of a wounded, crying girl. I was suspended (for my own sake).
What a responsible pet store owner did: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150302748834833&set=o.166535103426807&type=1&ref=nf Edit: Including the link that friday6700 included. http://www.wbng.com/news/local/Saturday--Petco-129586498.html I've been in the store, cages that are low that would have been impacted include: Cats (if they had any in), Tortoises, Spiders, Fish, Birds, Ferrets, various reptiles. Further edit: https://www.facebook.com/PETCO?sk=wall PETCO has released a statement, and deleted the facebook posts of people saying they were there to take the animals and denied. Further:Further Edit: I included Fish as some were salt water fish, and I am honestly not sure what could survive in the water that flooded the place, it had diesel fuel in it, sewer contaminants, gasoline from washed out stations, etc. Yes it was diluted, but overall not healthy. Last Edit: http://www.reddit.com/message/messages/5y7gt "You can go to http://broomegis.co.broome.ny.us/website/gisweb/gisapps.htm#, then click on UPIS. You can then use the buttons on the left to zoom and pan in to where PetCo is. Then click on Layers, to pick either FEMA, 2006, or SRBC. After picking a layer, click on "Update Map Layers". By doing this, you can see that the PetCo is a known flood region, and also flooded in 2006." This shows pretty well that PetCo's statement that they didn't know they were going to flood is pretty much garbage. It's in the flood area of 06. My real last edit, as I had two teeth ripped out today, and need to sleep to go help family and coworkers with their destroyed houses and basements tomorrow: I'm in Binghamton. People have been asking what area this happened in. Our area was smited again in a supposed "100 year" flood, even though it happened 5 years ago. People lost homes, jobs and property. No human lives were lost, we were lucky that way.
This may get lost at the bottom, but I have solid proof that debunks the statement issued by PetCo. Petco says: We are investigating why we did not receive those evacuation orders from the city if this area was known to flood in the past I have an email from NY-Alert, a statewide alert system that goes directly to the news and to the cell phones and emails of subscribers, that says the area in which the PetCo is located, is in imminent danger of major flooding. Issued By: Broome County Emergency Management Affected Jurisdictions: Broome County Headline: Susquehanna River will flood in Johnson City at or near same levels as 2006 record flood - If you evacuated in 2006 then you need to evacuate now. The Village of Johnson City is issuing a MANDATORY evacuation for low-lying areas in the village that are expected to flood by tomorrow morning. The Susquehanna River will flood to the same or nearly the same level as the record 2006 flood This email was sent at 6:36 PM on Wednesday. Petco also says:
I've never commented on Reddit before, but the wonderful stories shared here prompted me to say something. I've been married 19 years, and there are so many moments. I'll share the last and most important one. Last October my wife suddenly developed some strange symptoms that her physician couldn't explain. We scheduled a neurology appointment, but they couldn't fit her in for eight weeks. Within a few days we realized we couldn't wait, and I took her to the ER. After an MRI and CT scan they found five masses in her brain, and admitted her to the hospital. That night, both of us terrified beyond belief, my wife asked that I leave momentarily and buy a bottle of wine and sneak it back into the hospital. I did, and we drank a few glasses in secret. She then asked if I'd have sex with her. I of course said yes, although I was nervous that a nurse, doctor, or other hospital worker would walk in on us. In mid act, while trying to cover ourselves under the tiny blanket a nurse naturally walked right in. My ass was sticking out with my pants around my ankles. I was mortified, but my wife thought it was the funniest thing. Unfortunately, the masses turned out to be glioblastoma multiforme, a grade 4 brain malignancy. It's been such a scary yet wonderful time since that night. We WILL spend the rest of our lives together, I just hope it's much longer than her prognosis (11 months) suggests.
So I'll give my example here, I was reminded after reading the post about someone warning a kid buying from an undercover cop. Back when I was in school, the University newspaper ran a story about undercover cops using a younger, cute girl to camp outside the liquor store just off-campus and ask people to buy her beer. She'd give the people money, then ask them if they wanted to come back to her vehicle and share one as a way to say thanks. Get back to where her car is supposed to be, van door opens up, cops inside, and you'd get a ticket for underage buying. Later that evening, my friend and I were going to this same liquor store to get some beer, when we were approached by a cute girl, who asked us if we could buy her a six pack of beer since she was underage. Being a dumbass, I said sure, took her money and we went inside. About 10 seconds later I remember the piece about the undercover cops, and realized we were about to get arrested. At that point, we decided the best thing to do was to buy a 6 pack of super expensive root beer (blowing $9 of the $20 she gave us) and we put it in a paper bag. We walked back out, and she asked us "did you get it?" to which we said "yeah, of course." She invited us back to her car to have one each as a thank-you. Sure enough, we head to the back and there's the black van. The door opens up, cops sitting in there with headphones on etc. and they tell us "you're in a world of trouble now." I put on my best trollface and said "really? I really thought you guys could use some root beer sitting out here in that cramped van all night." There was an awkward pause, and then they opened the bag. Root beer, nothing else. Then they told us to get the fuck out of there, and we were interfering with a police investigation, and if we didn't leave we'd get arrested. We walked across the street to our apt. building went into the various laundry rooms and yelled out the window every time she approached someone that it was a sting. They left after 20 min. of that. tl;dr - cops tried to trick us into buying beer for an underage girl, we took their money and bought them root beer instead. edit: For those saying this would have been entrapment, it wouldn't have been. http://www.lectlaw.com/def/e024.htm A person is 'entrapped' when he is induced or persuaded by law enforcement officers or their agents to commit a crime that he had no previous intent to commit; and the law as a matter of policy forbids conviction in such a case. However, there is no entrapment where a person is ready and willing to break the law and the Government agents merely provide what appears to be a favorable opportunity for the person to commit the crime. For example, it is not entrapment for a Government agent to pretend to be someone else and to offer, either directly or through an informer or other decoy, to engage in an unlawful transaction with the person. So, a person would not be a victim of entrapment if the person was ready, willing and able to commit the crime charged in the indictment whenever opportunity was afforded, and that Government officers or their agents did no more than offer an opportunity. I would have been screwed, because of the three things required for entrapment, they didn't do #2 Second, the government agents then persuaded or talked the person into committing the crime. Simply giving him the opportunity to commit the crime is not the same as persuading him to commit the crime. She just asked, she didn't persuade. She offered the opportunity, that's it. If I'd said no, and she proceeded to badger me it would be entrapment, but I just say "sure".
So for the summer, we've had an intern. He started around June. He's a pretty cool guy, and he gets along well with the office. The first few weeks, he was fine. We gave him simple tasks to ease him in, which he picked up on. Over time, we gave him more and more, but nothing too hard or too high a work load. Now, for the past month or so, he's been completely slacking off. I noticed the work flow coming from him has slowed dramatically, and he seemed a bit more lazy in general. So, I asked my friends in the IT department to give me a report on his internet usage. Surprise surprise. Browsing the internet, plenty of reddit, even some youtube here and there. All times of the day, at a high volume. When we last talked, I brought up that work had slowed, and asked why. His response was that he felt his work had gotten more difficult - which is BS, because he's very qualified for what I've assigned to him. I'm not a tough boss, and I've never had to confront a worker before - our office has always had really great employees. So, how should I go about this? Give him a stern talking? A friendly one? A joking message through reddit that says "Get to work!" anonymously? He's a good kid, he's just been lazy lately. Edit: OP has not abandoned you all, don't worry. As for all the comments about interns shitting yourselves - good. It might be you I call into my office later today or tomorrow. Straighten up, and get to work. The more I from interns here, the more I want to prank him! Yes, I plan on talking to him either this evening or tomorrow morning. Yes, I will update. Some have asked how much he makes, and if it's for free: definitely not free labor - THEN I would probably understand. He makes around $18/hour if I recall correctly. Edit 2: The hour of reckoning is near. Edit 3: Edited the poor bastard's name out because the sound of so many interns shitting their pants in this thread is too beautiful. Unfortunately, there won't be time to call him in today - a meeting came up and I have other stuff to do by the end of the day. He'll be called in first thing tomorrow morning, and I will update you beautiful sons of bitches. Going to try and keep it light hearted, but at the same time keep firm that he does need to get more work done and that his browsing needs to decrease drastically. We are okay with some browsing, just not the amount he does. One last gem: called friend in IT, had him check again since he did earlier today. Looks like he cleared his browsing cache and cookies, probably upon seeing this thread. Stay tuned... Edit 4: Guys, we aren't hiring right now. I'm sorry :( Please don't PM me, I can't get you a job. If I could, I would - but you'd probably go on reddit as much as this guy. And then I'd have to come to r/askreddit on how to deal with the situation. And then I'd get more PM's asking to be hired. Edit 5: Really, we aren't hiring. I promise I can't get you a job. Update after our talk: So, I met with him in our small conference room this morning. He seemed really nervous. Asked how he was doing, how work was going, etc. Asked if he had anything to air out, if he was happy with his work, interested in it, etc, etc. He gave me mostly small answers like 'yes' and 'no', while remaining a little nervous. So I asked the "okay, well do you know why I asked you here?" while remaining friendly, not stiff (heh) or anything. He had this shit eating grin on his face and said "uhh, you don't go on reddit, do you?" to which I also had a shit eating grin on my face. We laughed, and I said how browsing the internet is fine, and I don't want to have to monitor him, but we need more work coming from him. So then I asked if he has trouble focusing, or is bored with work or whatever. It mostly came down his lack of focus, which I can completely relate to (I was very recently diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and we are close in age). We talked about things that would help him stay on track. I recommended getting up out of his cubicle every hour for 5 minutes, or walking around on our floor, and drinking plenty of water. Maybe take 5-10 minutes at lunch and go for a walk. He responded well to all of my suggestions, and I feel like the talk went great. Then I had to inform him where we go from here: like someone suggested here, I told him we're not here to baby sit, but to help him grow and learn as a programmer. We need to make sure his time is being used appropriately. If I notice another decrease in work, that's when the the punishments are going to have to get serious and I'm going to have to inform my boss about all of this, which will likely result in early termination. You know, to let him know we're cool, but we are still professional and work has to be done. I also told him if he feels like he's drifting again, or needs more assistance, to contact me before he goes back into this loop. As we parted, I said to take 10 mins to browse reddit or whatever, and then continue on his assignment. Little did he know I had my IT friend redirect reddit to his own "GET BACK TO WORK" page, just for a short while. I believe the problem is fixed. Thanks to all who gave input on the situation, to all interns who shat their pants upon reading this, to the few that sent me some seriously awesome FBI-level interrogation techniques, and to the many of you that inquired about jobs. No, I still can't get you one. I'm sorry. tldr: Thousands of interns produce brown fruit that flows into their sabatons upon reading this thread. Our guy was one of them. We're cool now. I'll leave it up to him if he wants to out himself here. Update thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x2zwk/update_our_summer_intern_has_gotten_lazy_what/
Oh hell, so many times. The first time, I started working at a porn store. I had only started working there like two weeks earlier, but the manager told me I was now his assistant manager, and I needed to fire the night shift guy. I got a (slight) raise, so I figured I pretty much had to do it. I was only 21, and had very little work (or life) experience. I didn't know how to fire someone. But, I did it. I came in to work the next morning to fire this guy. I didn't know what to say, so I was like "look, dude, I know this sucks, but as you know I've been made ASM, and my first order of business was to let you go." I barely got the words out before he was screaming at me, calling me names, telling me I didn't have the authority, and that he'd been there over a year.....and he refused to get out from behind the counter. So, I called my manager...but since he was a raging alcoholic, he was still passed out cold at 9 am. Meanwhile, the night shift dude called the owner of the business, who sent his son (one of the supervisors). I had the owner and the supervisor screaming at me (one in person, the other on the phone). The supervisor said that I needed to get the manager on the phone, and I better hope he answers, because if he can't fire him, he'd fire me instead.
So, one hour after I finished my last final, my mom calls to tell me she has just been suspended. She was told that she would get the remainder of her contract, which is payment until August, and was then ordered off the premise. I thought this was kind of shitty, but at least she has 8 month's pay. Today, the principal that fired her (she is a teacher), said they are breaching the contract and not paying her. Normally, this would be something she could take to her union, but she couldn't afford insurance and the union, so this was the first year she has not been in the union. The first year she is not in the union, and they fire her on christmas and breach contract. She called her old union rep and he said that they are fighting this kind of thing all over the place, but they won't represent her because this is the first time in 25 years that she was not paying union dues. She was even promised by the secretary that was going to handle the paperwork that she would get full pay, on wednesday. That secretary was fired today. The principal said, "If you want to fight it, hire a lawyer." I think that, collectively, we have 1,500 dollars between me, my brother and my mom, and the lowest that we have heard from a lawyer initally is 2 grand. *there is a tiny mortgage on the house (about 8 grand or so), but if she can't pay that, she is going to lose the entire house. I don't know what to do, my mom doesn't know what to do, and my brother is in the Navy, so he is completely oblivious to the problem. In summation, My mom's school district fired her, broke her contract because she was not in the union. Frankly, I only post this here because I'm desperate I have no idea what can even be done. * I wrote "I don't know what to do" twice here. This is effecting my posting skills. Alright, this is against all my better judgment, and I feel like a pandering idiot for even setting this up, but a lot of people are telling me to do it, so here, a donate button. I don't even know if I set that up right. Really what would be great is a lawyer in Kansas that would work Pro Bono, that would be the best thing. My favorite donation messages so far, "May your hovercraft be full of eels" - rsenic Another favorite comment sent via paypal, contained this link of relevancy: http://i.imgur.com/3oLHi.jpg "I'm drunk. Here's ten dollars" "You're awesome and art teachers were always the best, except that one weird guy in the 6th grade who always made us touch the glue gun glue ball that got lodged in the back of his hand. hope your mom finds something soon. keep your head up." - hueypriest I had a teacher that made everyone touch the piece of lead lodged in her hand. I understand. A $233 value donation was just made by someone. (Not really, they just sent the drawing.) "Here's another $12, I'll give you $50 more if you drive to Pittsburgh and let me throw a hamburger at you" Flying would be cheaper, I could maybe get a ticket from SouthWest for 60 bucks, and if you can cover that, you get to throw the hamburger at me for free. "I'm a grad student who spent all day working in a lab on heart disease. This is by far the most worthwhile thing I did today. That is meant both as a gesture of good will and a comment about grad school." - sokrasins Uhm, okay, thank you, but if you cured heart disease, that'd be pretty cool too. So uh, don't give up on that. "[insert witty comment here]" It is okay, I've had those kind of days too. Someone has messaged me that they may know of a lawyer that could help, or at least write a scary letter. I feel it's my obligation to update you all as much as I can... Soapier is awesome. It also smells really good. I tried it. My balls smelled like oranges for a month when I tried it. Maybe I shouldn't post that last sentence. Oh well. Okay, I'm going to take a little break and check on things in three or four hours, I'll bring updates then. By the way, everytime there is a paypal transaction, I get an email. I have 300 emails.* D: * make that 500 emails. I thought I'd update you all on the plan that has come up from all this: The NLRB keeps unions in check, and apparently what my mom's union has done may have been against the rules, and I have the form to submit to the NLRB concerning the union rep. If the union thing does not work, someone has contacted me with a lawyer they know that may take the case Pro Bono (oh, how many times have I written that today and wanted to write 'Pro-Boner') At the very least, a scary letter from a lawyer may do the trick and get the contract reinstated. If all else fails, your donations will at least keep things afloat for some time. Alternate 'If All else fails', taking this to the press. I list this as a last resort because I don't see my mom going for it. She feels really bad about the whole experience. That is all for right now. Being Friday night, not much can be done over the weekend in regards to this whole mess, so any real action will have to wait until Monday. I think this is why they fire people on Fridays... Edit: Update Tuesday the 29th or Wednesday the 30th, everyone that donated will be getting an email from my mom (at least, everyone whose email I could find) Update (for now)
When I was fifteen I "borrowed" my mom's car to pick up a friend who had gotten drunk and ended up in a bad situation with some boys. On the way home I lost control on some ice and slid into a tree at the entrance of my neighborhood. My mom is terrifying, but thankfully she goes to sleep early so when I called home I was relieved my dad answered. He came and pushed the car home, made my friend and I some sandwiches, gave me a lecture about driving without a license and put us to bed. The next day he told my mom that he had wrecked the car on an early-morning doughnut run. After that, I never hesitated to call my dad when I needed help, even when I knew doing so might land me in major trouble. EDIT: Thanks so much for all the kind words! I'm so happy my highest-ranked comment is about my awesome dad. I know I'm super lucky to have such an awesome dad and, for what it's worth, I didn't get off completely scott-free; my dad made me spend weeks learning to repair the damage to the car. It took ages but we got that thing up and running together.
I have two stories that I have been dying to tell: I had man come in for dinner (I work in a four star restaurant) sweating bullets from the time he sat down. He and the lady were obviously a couple and the entire staff guessed what would happen, especially after he ordered a $300.00 bottle of champagne to start the meal. She looked happy, but worried through the entire meal. When the dessert came he got down on one knee and I heard her say, "Please don't." Those two words stopped MY heart, I cannot imagine what this poor dude was going through. They had a hushed conversation and she ran out, literally ran, while he sat there still holding an open ring box. He finished the bottle of wine they had ordered during dinner, and pretty wasted turned to me and asked, "Why won't she let me love her?" Just like that. Like I am going to give him some kind of answer to explain the complex and painful thing that has just happened. I told him that sometimes we fall in love with the wrong people, and the only people worth anyone's time are the ones who give back what they get. He finished the bottle, paid his tab and walked slowly to the parking garage. I never saw him again. I used to wait tables at a Bob Evans that was located across the street from a nursing home. Whoever chose that location was a genius because old people love the shit out of Bob Evans. I had an elderly couple who came in every day for lunch and ordered the same thing. It got to the point that they I would have their meal on the table by the time I saw them crossing the street from the window. (They usually only got applesauce/banana bread/mashed potatoes.) One day the old man came in alone after a week of absence. He never said it, but I knew she had died. He still ordered for her, and let the food sit on her side of the table. Every. Day. I cried more than one time delivering it. I hope one day my future husband loves me that much.
I was doing some work with an engineering firm and there was a lady who was complaining about severe moisture and water build up in her apartment. After checking with all the other apartments around her and nobody else complaining we went to investigate. We knock on the door and the second she lets us in we are hit smack in the face with a wall of humidity. I mean like standing in Vietnam during monsoon time humidity. Its hot, extremely humid and just walking 5 feet in youre already saturated with water. We start the investigation and notice her carpet is soaked everywhere. Just squish squish squish as we walked through. I get to her sliding glass doors to her patio and no word of a lie there are 2' tall mushrooms growing out of her carpet. The water built up so badly on the glass doors and dripped down onto the carpet she had a 10' x 10' mushroom garden growing. Turns out the cause for it was found when I opened her closet. She had her son sneak in a clothes washer and dryer one night and 'installed' them into her closet without having proper plumbing for the washer and absolutely no ventilation for the dryer. So all the humidity from the dryer and washer were trapped in the apartment.
When I found out that I had slept with a band member's wife. This is a little convoluted, so bear with my poor story telling skills: I met a cute girl at a bar-gig, and we were attracted to each other. We went back to my place and sexed it up. We had "carnal relations" a few times after that. No big deal, just some occasional sex... Fast forward about five years - I'm in a different band, and this same woman walks in. I approach her during the break and give her a hug and make some small talk. My guitarist, Dave, comes up to me and says "Hey...how do you know Christine?" He's my friend, so I tell the truth. "She used to come see previous band and we hooked up a few times." "That's my ex wife, dude. We just got divorced six months ago." My heart dropped, and I'm close to panic-mode...Nearly ready to run out of the place. So I stammer "Dave, I'm so sorry! She didn't tell me that she was married!" "Yeah, I found out that she did that a lot. That's why we're divorced. Don't worry about it, man. You didn't know."
Yay! Here's the story, and here's a link to the original AskReddit thread, too: In 2009, we put together an anthology of Sesame Street’s then 40 year history. The end product of this anthology was a coffee table book, “Sesame Street: A Celebration – 40 Years of Life on the Street.” The book is extensive – a full color, 300-plus page masterpiece. The amount of research it took to produce the book? A years-long endeavor, involving multiple people digging through a seemingly endless trove of boxes and bins -- all of which, collectively, promised to tell the complete story of Sesame Street’s history. Except there was one item missing. In the summer of 1969, Sesame Workshop (then Children's Television Workshop) created an episode of Sesame Street -- an unaired test pilot shown only to a focus group of children. Later that year, on November 10, 1969 after incorporating the data gathered by this test pilot and many other sources, the first ever episode of Sesame Street – Episode 0001 -- debuted. The actor who played Gordon in the Episode 0001 was Matt Robinson, who held the role through season 3. In seasons four and five, Hal Miller took over. Since season six, Roscoe Orman has played the role. But the man who played Gordon in the unaired test pilot? We did not know who he was. And our records came up empty, the man’s identity, we feared, was lost to history. On November 10, 2011 – our 42nd birthday – we decided to ask the Internet for help. And congratulations, Internet: You found Gordon. Here's a pic of him from 1976, eight years after the episode was filmed. Gordon’s name was Garrett Hobart Saunders, an actor local to New York who primarily performed in traveling theater. Out of respect for the privacy of his family, we won’t be sharing the details of his life here. But the story as to how we found him – how you found him, well, here it goes. We posted our call for help everywhere we could think of, starting with SesameStreet.org. We shared it across our social media accounts – Facebook (even on Elmo’s and Cookie Monster’s pages), Twitter, and Tumblr as well. And we posted it to Reddit, where it quickly hit the front page. Within hours, people were making suggestions, and within days, the story travelled across the web and across mediums. It even made a few television news shows, one of which ended up being the big break. Mr. Saunders’ nephew saw a story of our search and immediately contacted his cousins – Garrett Saunders’ two daughters. Both women reached out to us later that day, providing us the photo above and the other information we needed. With their help, we were able to verify that Mr. Saunders was, in fact, the first Gordon. We’d like to thank everyone who helped us spread the word and ultimately, solve our mystery. And thank you, too, to Garrett Hobart Saunders, for being part of Sesame Street’s history. tl;dr: Gordon = found!
Today, while at work (library), a man came in and one of our regular patrons, a teen who's probably 15 or 16, came running up to him and gave him a hug. Turns out, the man is the teen's father. Now, through two years of seeing this kid almost every day, I know a few things about him: he's in foster care, his mom OD'd last year, he grew up on the streets, he was abused by several of his mom's boyfriends. So I was surprised to see he had a dad, honestly. But it became quickly apparent (to everyone else) that the dad wasn't that in to seeing his son. But the boy could not see that. He was talking all about his life, his group home, his younger brothers, etc. Then he says, "Why don't we go to lunch? Let's go to Wendy's" (right across the street.) The dad goes, "Sure, let me go get my wallet, I'll be right back." And he walks out the door and doesn't come back. At all. This kid stood in the middle of the library for like an hour, then went back and forth between us and Wendy's for the rest of the day. A co-worker and I ended up sitting in the parking lot with this kid for like two hours after we closed, just letting him cry. This is a teenager who has seen and experienced the very worst things, many of them probably at the hands of his father, and yet he wanted so desperately to be part of his life. I've literally never felt so gutted in my life. All I want to do is tell this story to Liam Neeson, see the rage simmer, and then set him loose on this scumbag...
My grandmother & grandfather were born in 1900. ( Yes, one hundred and twelve years ago.) He lost a leg at Verdun. My father was shot in Italy and France. My grandmother's grandfather was in the Civil War, and I remember her telling me stories of him. My grandparents didn't have electricity, running water or flushing toilets until I was in middle school. My paternal grandparents were pretty much the same. I now think back to how I thought about things when I was young, and I realize exactly HOW much times have changed.... I remember WHITES ONLY toilets and water fountains... and never even thought about it. (actually, I also remember being quite sure that the Beatles caused communism....). I remember before there were malls, and we went downtown to shop. (I remember, because I had to wear white gloves, and I was forever losing them and/or getting them dirty) (which was NOT acceptable behavior for girls....) I remember our maids. I remember Dark Shadows, the Batman show on TV, and Twilight Zone. I remember JFK's death, the race riots in the 60's, MLK's killing, Challenger and 9/11. My mother remembers Pearl Harbor, and my grandmother would tell me about the end of WWI.... What, I wonder, will you remember? Edit: Obligatory "Wow, front page!". Also, got found out by my son. Bowing (without throwing out my back) graciously in your general direction. Edit2: Genius Son here. Post proof as requested: http://i.imgur.com/rRRpl.jpg
Hi all. I'm a psychiatrist. My main area of clinical work is emergency psychiatry, and my main research interest is functional brain imaging. I'd like to start a discussion about the rapist thread, which I see as a serious danger. In a nutshell: Rape is a crime which sometimes hinges directly on feelings of power over the victim. That power often loses its meaning if the victim is unconscious. Many rapists typically need a victim who knows they are being victimized. This victim is the rapist's audience. This is crucial. The audience gives the rapist pleasure, euphoric delight from unfettered, witnessed suffering. That euphoria is intense and is possibly driven by the same neurobiology involved in a drug high. Now, when Reddit invites rapists to retell their stories, they offer an audience of thousands. The possibility that individuals reading these stories will be horrified afresh is very appealing to some rapists. It’s neurobiologically very much like anticipating drug use. Note: the audience doesn’t actually need to be horrified. In the mind of the rapist, the possibility of horrifying an audience is what is appealing. Ever wonder what makes addicts keep using? A major factor is the craving that comes from recalling the feelings associated with the pleasurable activity or drug. Cocaine addicts, active or in recovery, who are asked to think about using cocaine have measurable brain changes precisely when they report cravings. We haven't actually measured this in rapists, but we suspect it's highly analogous. Thus, the Reddit rape forum is very possibly triggering rape cravings in rapists. It is also teaching rapists how to rape better via shared stories, the same way we teach new participants to improve in any field, by sharing our experiences. I plan to be available to discuss this, so jump in. (For those more curious about the guy behind the message, I'm a frequent guest on the Caustic Soda Podcast.) Edited at 6:43 pm to eliminate gendered language. My apologies for insensitivity! I was pretty anxious when I was writing this, and my bias showed. Any gender can rape any gender. Second edit at 7:09 pm (Pacific): My credentials Third edit at 7:19 pm: Edit #2: Caustic Soda has confirmed my identity on their Facebook page. Fourth edit, 2:09 pm 31 July: My point is that speech has power, and it can be dangerous. I wanted to outline why it might be dangerous in this instance. Is censorship the answer? No. Responsible and accountable speech is the answer. I don't know what the answer is. That question is in the domains of law and philosophy, for it is a question of values, a question about how the world ought to be. My point is about how the world is, and it stands whether or not there is free speech. Also, yes, I fully agree that rape is a complex phenomenon with multiple motives. I'm speaking specifically about sadistic, serial rape, which can indeed involve euphoria and the triggering of cravings. I've made edits above as well to soften the tone. Also, removed the distracting asterisks. Fifth edit: a number of people have requested links to research about rape and rapists. All links are to free, full-text articles, so you can read in depth if you wish. Here we go... Male rapists in this sample were 1.5x as likely to have been physically violent to a female partner Male rape is 2x more likely in societies where gender inequity is normalized In this sample of 1686 men, 466 had raped a woman, and 251 were multiple rapists. The most common motivation "stemmed from ideas of sexual entitlement." Men do indeed get raped and they have enormous difficulty disclosing this In this sample of 2049 men, 376 reported forced sex, a finding "consistent with assessments from Western countries." In violent offenders, there are close relationships between substance abuse and consequent criminal offences such as "physical assault, rape, armed robbery, attempted murder and homicide." Highly psychopathic individuals, including serial rapists, have measurable differences in brain morphology compared to controls (Not available as free full text.)
I'm still somewhat just blankly staring at this email I just got. Reading it over and over again. I know many won't get the same feeling from it, but if you were there, knew the person, and understood what he was going through at the time and how he expressed himself... it's as if everything clicks into place and makes sense. http://imgur.com/hbPIE (the email) For background info, I did an AMA a while back on travelling around spontaneously with no travel plans (http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/w85a6/iama_spontaneous_solo_traveller_ill_take_your/). I mentioned in that last one I was leaving for another trip in the upcoming week. That trip occured this past July, and during it, I decided to hop on a random cruise ship to Croatia where I met this guy. We talked and after hearing how I had no place to go when I reached there, he invited me onto his boat/yacht. Over the course of a 2 days, we sailed around the Adriatic Islands on his private boat, drank beer and just talked. After we docked back into the marina, we said our goodbyes and the only contact I had with him was a single email thanking him for his hospitality. This morning, I received this email. I still have no idea how to reply or respond to this, but its shocking to know that even the smallest gesture makes the biggest difference in someone's life.
I was in Hong Kong on business, so my colleague and I went to Repulse Bay. We met up with some girls we'd previously met, drank all day on the beach, hung out, made new friends and we're all hitting a volleyball when a guy our age (early 20's) comes up to us his voice in a panic saying his friend is buried and they can't get him out of the sand. I immediately thought this was some prank, so we go over to the kid and literally all you can see is an arm sticking out of the sand, so we try pulling it and all you can hear is a muffled scream. When we realized whats going on and tried to get closer, the sand caved in and the arm began frantically waving in a panic. Immediately I started digging in the sand with 4 other people to find this kids head and then I found it and we dug a small air pocket around his mouth. After about 5 minutes of carefully digging and pulling, we pulled him out. The beach was empty aside from us and it was getting pitch black out. Kind of crazy I saved some kids life in Hong Kong.
Following the footsteps of these guys, I want to have a reddit-powered epic summer adventure. I have the ability to travel on the cheap. Want me to hand deliver a letter to someone across the country or overseas? Attempt to help you with homework? Volunteer at your organization for a day? Need an extra pair of hands to do that landscaping project you've been putting off for months? Know a sweet hiking spot but have no one to go with? I will attempt to complete the highest voted tasks to the best of my abilities (IE they take place in destinations I can reach- most major cities worldwide except and almost any US destination, and I don't get an unlucky string of fully booked flights). Be sure to say the city your request takes place in. Feel free to assign me random adventures where ever you live. I plan on documenting all this, taking pictures and video at each destination, and am looking to purchase a video camera-- can anyone recommend something lightweight? Also-- if anyone else has similar benefits you're welcome to join me for any/all of the journey. We could take turns filming! I intend on beginning my journey starting on May 7th and continuing into late July. Miscellaneous note about me: 22 year old male unemployed college student B.Sc. in forensics American citizen I won't do anything illegal-- if you want a package delivered I'd like to inspect the contents first ಠ_ಠ Can speak conversational Spanish Other skills: amateur game design/mod enthusiast, cooking, playing guitar badly and singing badly Likes: hiking, caffeinated tea, rock climbing, long walks on the beach EDIT [1]: Official Subreddit EDIT [2]: sub to r/ReVenture (above) if you want to follow the whole thing (wow, I feel like a youtube channel already). I'm going to spend the next week reading through EVERY post and coming up with an itinerary that maximizes adventure & help/travel time ratio. Future communication will be through the subreddit. Twitter if you're into that sort of thing In the mean time I'm off for a few days to visit family
Basically I was 9 years old and my parents were picking me up from school (we lived about 150m down the road so they would walk with the dog to the school to pick me up). She was great around all the kids and never hurt anyone. Then one day this exceptionally dicky kid came up to "pat" my dog on the head. This pat however was pretty much just a punch to the nose, which my dog did most certainly not like. So she bit the kid on the hand (didn't even draw blood), and the kid made a huge scene after which my dog was banned from the school. As we lived in a very crowded suburban area, the school oval/park was the only place we could walk her so instead of letting her never be able to get rid of energy we promptly 'sent her off to the farm'. My brother, being 10 years older and very considerate, told me that the real reason we gave her away was because the ranger made us put her down, and my parents were just trying to be nice. I believed this for a few (very sad) months before finally travelling down south to my uncle's farm and be beyond delighted when i found out she was still alive. So reddit, what's your lying-but-honest parent story?
So, I walked into a Safeway today to find some Greek God yogurt, the honey variety and I stopped at the deli. A lady was waiting there. She looked to be an impoverished little elderly black woman (I am not being classist, or ageist or sexist or racist here, I just like to visually paint pictures) anyway, she said she had been waiting for 45 minutes and no one would wait on her. When they finally did, she asked the price of an egg roll and the fried wontons. It was evident she didn't have much. Finally in frustration, she said, "Forget it," and started to leave. That just felt so wrong. I called out, "Stop, stop, you can't leave, come back here. Pick your dinner out. I'll buy it." It came to a mere $7.50 or so. The thought of someone walking home hungry, feeling broke and mistreated just felt so wrong. I told her that I had just sold a book and the meal was no big deal. She asked about the book and I told her about my friend, Darryl's cancer and how it was important to get it done to honor what a gift he is to me and how much I love him. She said that her husband had cancer. We walked out and I grabbed her a copy of the book and signed it for her. She said she had a book she was working on. She hugged me and said, "I love you." For a mere $7.50 I got an "I love you," from a stranger. Best $7.50 I have spent in a long time.
I go to this noodle and bubble tea shop near my apartment about once a week. The food is affordable and I basically drink water or tea, so what the hell, right? Last Thursday while I was drawing some things in my sketchbook as I ate, the two girls next to me had a third friend arrive, late, seemingly upset. She then went on and on about how bad her life has been lately. How nothing since the new year has gone right for her. How her thesis is in trouble (so a senior in college?) and how this is the last time she can go out with friends (A noodle shop?) for the next four months. It might be a little bit dramatic to others, but you can tell she was unhappy and that's what I picked up. I felt like, "Nothing good has happened since the new year? That needs to stop." So when I paid my bill, I went up to the waitress and mumbled to her so the girls didn't hear, "Let me pay for her drink." The waitress was confused, "I overheard her talking and she seems unhappy, so let me pay for her drink." "Oh...Okay?" "I think she got the taro flavor?" Finally the waitress follows, tells me to pay about $4.50. I do so, and leave as fast as possible so they don't know what I did. Fast forward to the following Tuesday, I go back to the noodle shop for my weekly visit, I'm sketching again and then I get a tap on my shoulder. A girl starts complimenting my drawings and asks about me. She then goes, "Were you here last Thursday?" I pause, "Yeah?" "I was sitting with my friends next to you when you were here." I was startled cause I never expected to get a response, "Uh... Yeah." "You paid for my friend's drink?" "Oh, yeah. She said something like how nothing good happened this year for her and I felt like that needed to change a bit." She replied, "Well you made her day." I always expected to be anonymous, but it was still nice to have confirmation that she felt better. I will do more random things like this in the future.
Oh man... The door opening noise happens, out of the corner of your eye you see it's your school crush, with her purple willowy username that contains symbols like ~¤<3. Immediately adrenalin starts pumping, you get all nervous and sweaty, ... You immediately open up a chat window, but you wait a minute, you don't want to seem desperate or stalker-like. The anticipation is palpable, heightened by the gritty lyrics of Linkin Park playing in the background "craaaawling in my skiiiin..." . You begin to type, "hello", , "hey ;)" . With your pulse now at its max, you take the plunge and slam the enter key, . You wait, and watch, your sight dead set on the screen, waiting for her reply, like some military general in his war room awaiting the word on the mission. And then, without warning, the door closing noise, your crush is gone. Amazing that a noise so simple can crush a man's dreams in just an instant. With nothing left to do, tears in your eyes, you load up counter strike, you need to awp some n00bs to clear your mind. *tomorrow...*you tell yourself .
When I worked at a banquet hall in a hotel, I had a manager (who we'll call steve) who treated everyone like shit, calling us stupid, calling us out on things not even the managers above him cared about, and just generally being an asshole. One day he puts this pissy memo on the bulletin board about not eating left over food (none of the other managers cared about this, and it actually went in the garbage if nobody ate it), but instead of signing his name, he put "banquet management". Well, as a joke I scratched that out, and wrote "-Steve". A couple minutes later, he walks over to the bulletin board, sees this, and starts screaming "WHO WROTE THIS?!", and then runs to his boss down the hall, and starts complaining, and the guy just doesn't know what to say and shrugs. Well, the entire staff saw this and thought it was hilarious, so we start writing "-Steve" on everything. Over the next few weeks Steve gets more and more pissed, and launches an "investigation" saying that he's analyzing the handwriting (at this point he still thinks it's just one person, despite the fact that the entire staff is in on this joke). He never really figured it out, and I'm not sure how crazy it drove him, but he did get fired for drinking on the job.
I left Bank of America years ago and I haven't been more happy. Its been my experience that they always seem to find ways to suck more money out of you. I left them because one day their system had a glitch where it said my balance was a certain amount, so I removed some money. Ends up I didn't have enough money and now it was Non-sufficient funds (NSF). Even though they admitted that their system messed up, I still got charged then INS fees and had to return the extra money. I had no problem returning the money but paying a fee for their mistake was what put me over the line because this wasn't the first time they said I had pay bogus fees for no reason. Now they want to charge people $5 a month just to use your debit card. Do the math: BofA has 57 million consumer and small-business accounts. If a majority of them uses debit cards, BofA will make about $3 billion a year — or $1 billion more than BofA is currently making from transaction fees. We bail them out and now they want even more money. They charge us to store our money there then want to charge us to use our own money.
I had a teacher in Middle School who was really into history. Like REALLY into history. For every new ancient history unit that we had, he would dress up as a person from that time. For the ancient Egyptians unit, he dressed up as an Egyptian embalmer, and he had a mock embalming ritual behind a screen with a light behind it. He acted out each individual step, showing us how they took out each organ, using different props to put on a little show for us. For ancient Greece, he dressed as a spartan hoplite, complete with replica armor and weapons. Each piece of this costume was his pride and joy, having been collected over a decade from the internet/ antique dealers and such. That was the first (and last!) time that I saw actual weapons (a 15'' spear with a leaf bladed tip on one end, and a 'lizard sticker' on the other, and a short sword almost identical to the actual spartan xiphos) that were more than capable of killing people. For the final unit, ancient Rome, he dressed as a Gothic warrior. He even had a tattoo that covered his entire arm which was identical to a common ancient Gothic warrior tattoo. I thought that he was the man, and he always invited my friends and I to stay in his room with him every lunch and talk about history, or just anything really. He inspired me so much that for most of my school career I wanted to be a teacher just like him.

As said in the title, my parents have worked hard all their lives for their family. We never had really nice stuff but they always gave everything they could while putting off their own desire. I'm the youngest and now in my mid 20s, so my parents should be able to wind down and get ready for retirement, do a bit of travelling, etc. Unfortunately with their financial situation (+11 grandkids to spend money on), that won't be happening. My parents always talked about going on a trip but it's never happened. Dad works for weeks at a time, staying in camps doing 12 hour days and only coming home on (some) long weekends. It makes me sad that he works so hard with no end in sight, so it's the least we can do to show our gratitude for all the love and help they've given us. Originally I was thinking some all-inclusive type package where they can just relax but I'm not sure it's really up their ally. One of my brothers suggested Ireland (we live in Canada) because both sides of the family originate there and I know both of my parents have expressed a desire to see that country over any other. Some questions I have are: What is the best way to look for deals on international flights? I know of expedia and that's about it. What kinds of places would you want to stay? What cities are best for travelling? Are there any dangerous places you would recommend avoiding as a tourist? Is Christmas a good time to visit a country like Ireland? My sister also suggested their anniversary (in June), which still gives them 6 months to organize themselves but may be tougher for my dad as far as time off work goes. Thanks for any help! Edit 1 - So many insightful and informative responses! Lots of good points, some already considered and some not. I will respond whenever I can, since I'm at work right now. Thanks Reddit! Edit 2 What an overwhelming response! I have my reading cut out for me.. Thank you all foer sharing your advice and bringing up details I hadn't even thought of. For those saying it's a bad idea, it's not. We will ultimately do what's affordable and reasonable with the decisions on where/when left up to my parents. The surprise will be when we tell them that we are sending them on a trip. Someone suggested having a couple small travel gifts to give them at that time which I think is a good idea. I'm so excited to put this together, and want to thank you all again for your help and advice.
I fly home to Ireland from Canada twice a year. During the summer, cheapest flights are with Airtransat. The seats are also the least comfortable and the food the worst though. If you're not travelling with them I would recommend that you send them in the summer, you get direct flights that way. You do not want 60 year old people who've never flown before having to transfer in JFK or heathrow. Then again I dunno where in Canada you are and if you're in Vancouver...jesus. I wouldn't book the flights. Make a sweet card detailing what you're giving them. but don't tie them down. Ireland is a great place to travel to, no matter what time of year. Driving in the winter is tricky, the rural roads are of poor quality, and you get a lot of black ice. There are so many things for them to see. Obviously their ancestral homes. Depending where that is then you have things like Connemara, the Burren, Rock of Cashel, The Blarney Stone, Newgrange, the giant's causeway and all of Dublin, Galway, Belfast, Cork, Kilkenny and wherever else to see. Go to r/Ireland and ask for advice there. I think it's a wonderful sweet idea, but do it in the summer time. Its better for them to travel and gives you all more time to plan it now rather scramble for flights.
I encourage everyone to think about this and respond. I find it is a good way to figure out if you've been making the most of your time. It doesn't need to be something that will impress everyone, just think about it on a personal level. EDIT: Now that I think that this post is just about to reach it's peak I think it is time for me to explain the purpose of this little exercise. I find that many people that live busy day to day lives often don't have the time nor energy to take a step back and notice the little things that they have done, only focusing on the bigger things that they are about to do. The little steps that are over looked can often make us feel slightly proud of ourselves and can give the boost that is needed to reach the overall goal, so when looking back on it, we haven't just enjoyed the outcome, but the process as well. On the other hand, there are people who don't feel like they lead full busy lives. This idea of reflecting on the most positive thing you've done recently gives you a little pat on the back, showing you that you have been doing something no matter how small or insignificant you think it is. In future if you ever find yourself rushed, anxious or just feeling a bit down and out, just think of this and every single time you do, you will always find a boost in your self worth. TL:DR: Just think of this occasionally in future. Note: This may have come out a bit garbled because it's 3 am at time of writing but I'll fix it in the morning if I have to.
He was speaking in Ontario. He is a great speaker and I was very impressed with his speech/interview. EDIT: Was quite impressed with all the comments and feedback on here when I woke up this AM. Even the silly comments. Some answers to questions I have received: Clinton was speaking at the Ontario Economic Summit in Toronto. At one point he actually said that he feels he should be taxed more. I'm not sure how this impacts discussions here, but some people seem to think this is a critical fact that is needed. I don't think it matters myself. I don't have a transcript or a video and I'm not sure if one will become available, if so I will share. I'm not opposed to OWS, I'm not for OWS either. Many people, including Clinton, have a hard time supporting OWS because it isn't entirely clear what OWS stands for. It is too broad. I'm no longer a banker, I work close in the area of public policy, I'm not the government that OWS is opposed to. I'm FOR distribution of wealth. Though in my meetings that is not my direct message. I state problems and offer solutions. I tackle issues one at a time. When I worked for a bank, I was NOT the 1%. It is PART of why I left, not that I was looking to become the 1%, I just didn't agree with the direction the banks are going. Even the CDN banks. Clinton IMO was simply offering advice, I don't believe he was speaking out against OWS, in fact I think he wants them to be successful. I could be wrong, he is a great word smith as some have said. Another personal opinion: If I judged you based on your past, specifically a 1-5 key negative elements of your past, would YOUR own advice be valid? I know I have made some major errors in my past. I agree Clinton has goofed up royally in the past, but I think he offers a valid point. Also I feel that because OWS has decentralized itself, it also opens itself up to individuals who may be a little too right wing and they discredit the OWS movement. i.e. those protesting things like oil in the general sense and are doing it under the OWS movement. FOCUS is needed and I personally believe that some sort of centralized publicity needs to take place. I feel like OWS is trying to speak on our behalf as the 99%, yet I can't support such a disorganized cause that lets many factions speak on my behalf that I don't really agree with. Anyway, I posted this to open dialogue, that was my only motive. I'm not saying I'm a Clinton supporter or I'm against OWS, just helping set the stage for discussions on where OWS is going. Cause I don't know and that makes it hard for me to share my support to them. In my own town, all OWS has done is provide a home for the homeless, for now. EDIT 2: For the purposes of dialoguing the statement, I should have just left out who said it. I feel like some of you are more concerned with who said it, than the validity of the point. Great discussions here regardless. Thanks everyone. And I wish I could read ALL the comments, but there are far too many now.
Could he do it? Yes. Could he do it legally? No. To launch into orbit as a company you need a launch license from the FAA. If you are returning to Earth, you need a reentry license as well. If you will be communicating with earth, you will also need permits for the radio frequencies you use. "Aha", some people in this thread will say, "so you launch from another country without these requirements, or from the ocean!" No. The FAA claims jurisdiction over a US citizen doing a launch anywhere in the world. It's much easier to get a launch license to launch at sea (FAA-AST [Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation] folks I've talked to said that SeaLaunch had the easiest launch license process ever) but you still have to get a license, even in "international waters". What is a launch license? You basically submit the entirety of your rocket's design to the FAA, and they look over the whole thing and decide if it's safe or not. One aspect of that safety is called "Ec", pronounced eee-sub-see, which is expected casualties. It is a function of the probability that your rocket will crash (evaluated by you in your license application and reevaluated by the FAA), the area that it would likely crash or could possibly crash, and the population of those areas. It's a probabilistic measure of how many people you will injure or kill, on an average launch.
I was 14 and two girlfriends and I had gone to the theatre in my neighbourhood to see Ghost Rider (my first mistake, I know). We had gone to the 10pm show, so it let out around midnight. It's the only large theatre in the area so it's always filled with moviegoers, but there is very little staff and the hallways are deserted when any movies are in progress. This is all especially true for the late night shows. When our movie finished, my friends went to the bathroom, as is necessitated by the female movie theatre ritual, and I elected to wait out in the secondary lobby. That was probably my second mistake. This theatre, due to its lack of staff, often has more people sneaking into the theatre than people paying for tickets. It is very, very easy to simply waltz in through a side door when another person is walking out. I was the only one in the hallway which made me a target for an extremely large, homeless/cracked-out-looking 40+ year old black man (only relevant because I'm pale as fuck and he could not pass as my dad). He was built like a truck. Generally I'm extremely outgoing and can talk with strangers easily; however, the moment I noticed this fellow approaching, an overwhelming sense of fear washed over me and my brain kept telling me to get out of there fast. My naive 14-year-old self decided to stay where I was, thinking: "There's no way in hell anything bad could happen to me since I'm obviously invincible to the world. Bad shit only happens in the news. Don't judge a book by its cover, aphrodite_whities! He's probably a lovely guy." He approached and asked me if I had any cigarettes. I said no and that I didn't smoke, when he suddenly reached out and grabbed my hand. He stood there shaking my hand saying how he was just dying for a cigarette, increasing his deathgrip every time I tried to pull my hand away. He kept closing the distance between us while strangling my hand and eventually he had me backed into a corner, all the while he keeps fiddling around with something in his pocket (I don't know what it was; he never took that hand out of his pocket the entire time). He kept saying how he wasn't even there to see a movie, just wanted some cigarettes. He was insistent that we go get cigarettes and kept trying to steer me towards the side door. I was so scared that I was probably on the brink of pissing myself. I looked to see if anyone was around, only to notice my two friends standing outside the bathroom door -- not doing anything while this man was forcing his body onto mine in a public place. They were the only people around and they were just standing there. Understandably, they later said they were confused as to what was happening and didn't know what to do. Thankfully, a movie lets out right in front of where the man has me trapped. Every single person passed by without so much as a second glance. Shit, I thought, I'm gonna get kidnapped. This man wouldn't take his eyes off of mine for a second, and pushed his chest against mine every time I looked around for help. I was too afraid to yell. Suddenly, a group of three guys (probably only around 15 or 16 years old) came straggling out of the theatre. They didn't notice me at first, but just as they were rounding the corner out of the lobby, one of them turned around and stared at me oddly. He mouthed "do you need help?", and I nodded as discreetly as I could. The guy came running up and threw his arm around my shoulders, saying things along the lines of "thanks for waiting, babe. You ready to go? That was a great movie, huh? I'm glad we went in the end. Who's this guy?!" The man instantly lets go of my hand, keeping his other hand in his pocket, and backs away quickly, mumbling how he just wanted a cigarette, and then he ran out of the emergency exit at the back of the lobby. My guy escorted me outside, and I was in such a state of shock that I think I just hugged him and ran away to my mom who had been waiting in the parking lot. I had been so sure that no one was going to help me, not even my friends, and in such a moment of panic I was really not thinking straight enough to follow the steps I should have (i.e. yell for help). Ever since, I've made an effort to make sure I'm aware of my surroundings just in case someone needs help but can't ask. Haven't "saved" anyone yet, but only time will tell! The extent of my "paying it forward" is saving girls from bad situations at the bar, nothing heroic yet, but hopefully I'll be able to help someone out when they really need it. So, Reddit, what has a stranger done for you that made you want to pay it forward? TL;DR: 14yo me didn't go to the bathroom after a movie, ended up wanting to piss my pants while being harassed by a man in the lobby. Random guy pretended to be my boyfriend, scaring off the creep and potentially saving my life. (I also just want to add, in case this guy is a redditor and remembers saving some girl that one time, a sincere thank you. It has haunted me since that night that I never thanked you for what you did. Thank you.)
19 years old, incredibly sketch looking (long hair, beard, piercings, the works) and I was with my best friend on a trip to New York from Vancouver, Canada. We were staying in Times Square but we went to a concert in Long Island and ended up taking really late transit home. Enter the crackheads. A man and a woman clearly addicted to drugs get on the train and sit across from my scrawny pale friend and my equally scrawny white self and start to inexplicably pick a fight with us, accusing us of making fun of them or something, I don't know, probably just an excuse to beat the shit out of us and maybe take whatever we have on us. The man becomes physically threatening when out of nowhere, an exceptionally large (probably 400 pounds+) black man with a thick New York accent says "Out of the way, fatty needs a seat" to me, temporarily defusing the situation. He then proceeds to pull jawbreakers out of his pocket and hands them to my friend and I while telling a story of the jawbreakers he used to steal from kids at school. When the crackhead gets beligerant again, the huge dude instantly changes the topic to his current bodyguard job and tells stories of smashing people's faces into cement walls and putting bad people into the hospital. The crackhead shut the fuck up and got his girlfriend off of the train at the next stop, and we rode the rest of the way back to the hotel with this awesome dude talking about our favourite candies and the fastest ways to get to the center of a jawbreaker. Very welcoming first night in New York!
I was working in a restaurant chain you have heard of if you live in the U.S., and the management were complete dicks. They all of a sudden decided that everyone had to work split shifts if they were working that day, they would give me write-ups for giving customers exactly what they asked for - in front of the customers - shit like that. So one day, the hot water was out. Completely. No hot water for washing hands, washing dishes, nothing. So here I am thinking 'Yeah, extra day off from this shithole' and told the manager. His response was that he didn't care. The staff reminded him of health code regulations, and he still did't care. So I promptly went to the bathroom and called the health department to file a complaint. They had an inspector there in under an hour, and shut the place down for the day. Justice, right? But it gets better - the manager starts getting crazier by the day. He starts suspending people for putting one extra slice of tomato on a salad, or not having the crease on the arm of their shirt continue into their cuff, really harsh punishments for very minor infractions. But the health code violations are getting worse. The hot water keeps going out, and occasionally power to one of the walk-in refrigerators would cut out, things like that. Well every time it would play out the same way. Something would go out, management would not close as they are required to do by law, I would call the health department - sometimes the inspector directly as I now had his cell number - and they would come out and shut the place down until the problem was fixed.
This just happened about 20 minutes ago in downtown Boston. I was at the corner of a major intersection waiting to cross when an adorable kid in his Sox garb pulled away from his texting mother and try to cross on his own. By the time I realized what was really happening the kid was about 10 feet in front of an armored data tape truck which based on how high the cab is I don't think the driver could have even seen the kid if he was looking. A girl who looked like she was about 25 stepped into the street and lifted the kid up by the arm and pulled him back onto the curb as the truck skidded to a stop. I was shocked and impressed, I had watched the whole thing happened and in no way could have responded so quickly. Well instead of thanking the woman that just stopped her child from dying in front of her the mother went absolutely bonkers. She started screaming "How dare you touch my child" along with a string of obscenities. The young woman kept her cool for about 30 seconds of screaming before telling the mom that next time she'd just let the kid get hit before storming off. So reddit - what are you best stories of public stupidity?
A couple of weeks ago, I watched a mother try to drag her toddler in one of those smaller, flimsy cloth strollers onto an escalator. It was around 5 PM in an area where there's a lot of 9-5 business folk, so there was a line of about 5 people waiting to get on the escalator. Instead of taking the elevator that's literally 20 feet away, she lifts up the kid, still in the stroller, and tips up the front end of it to balance it between two of the moving steps. The stroller gets caught on the side, and the kid falls foward, landing face-first into the metal edge of the upper step. Cue everyone, who is kinda watching in slow motion awe-horror, take in this collective breath as we wait for the kid to get some fingers chopped off or lose an eye or something. Kid starts WAILING and the mom just stands there, propping the stroller up. The guy ahead of them turns around and helps the poor toddler up, who now has a bright red mark smack on her forehead. The guy says "seriously lady? You could've killed your kid." while doing his best to make sure the kid isn't bleeding and/or seriously injured in some way. Woman goes "GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY CHILD" and makes a big huff about people needing to mind their own business. Minor stupidity I guess but I've heard horror stories about escalators and children my whole life, I THOUGHT IT WAS INGRAINED THAT YOU DON'T DO THAT SHIT.
So I lived in an apartment with three other girls, one of whom was pretty into drugs. She started off just doing coke recreationally, but soon it became a daily thing. Anyway, she developed a pretty nasty addiction which went on for a few months. During this time, she got with this other druggie dude and had unprotected sex with him like fives times in one weekend, full cream pie each time. She was very scared she was pregnant (durr), but all she could do was hang out and wait a few weeks. And then this happened. Our buddy Johnny was over hanging out when she walks out of the bathroom looking like she's just seen a ghost. We ask her what's up, and she says she thinks she had a miscarriage. She said it felt like she took a shit and then there was blood and skin tissue in the toilet. But then it gets worse. She says that's not all. Since she thought she was pregnant, she had ODed on coke every night the past week in an attempt to force a miscarriage. I am stunned at this point how anyone could be so insane and all-around irresponsible. But then it gets worse. We kind of let the issue pass, until my crazy roommate does her coke with a more experienced friend who says, "Hey this isn't coke...." They test it, and turns out she's been snorting meth and baking soda daily for months.
A few years ago, I went to visit my grandparents in India. They live in a small town, which is very old and quaint. People often let their pet dogs walk around the town by themselves. When my grandparents have leftover scraps of food, they leave them outside on a bowl so that these neighborhood dogs can have a treat. However, it's usually pigeons and/or crows that eat it up first. So one day, I was sitting outside the house, and a crow swooped down to eat some of the food. I don't know why, but for some reason I made a loud "CAWW" sound (like a crow makes). Instantly, this crow looks up like "wut?" So I make the sound again. This crow freaks out. It starts cawwing too. Two more crows fly down from the opposite roof. I'm feeling awesome, so I call my grandma and cousin out, and continue cawwing. Within two or three minutes, I kid you not, we had around 30-40 crows gathered in the area, all cawwing. I just kept on going with it, and after about 5 minutes, there were roughly 50 crows on the ground and 20 on the opposite roof. To this day, my cousin still calls me The Crow Whisperer. TL;DR: I summoned about 70 crows to my side just by making a "CAWW"ing sound. EDIT: In answer to some of these questions: I did it two more times during that trip, to show my friends. Worked just as well each time! I came back home to America, and tried it here in my backyard, when I saw two crows; it didn't work at all. The American crows didn't even look up... may have been on to something with the whole "regional dialects" theory. Interesting stuff... I'm going back to India again this year, and although it's been about 5 years, I'm gonna try it again. And this time I'll record it for you guys! Here's hoping it works!
There's a game we made up as teenagers. You just shuffle a deck of cards, and everybody takes turns picking the top card. Depending on the suit of the card you had either do truth (hearts), dare (diamonds), drink a shot (spades), or remove an article of clothing (clubs). So it was basically truth or dare, strip poker, and every drinking game ever invented all combined. Then there was the other game we played where each suit represent mouth (hearts), hands (diamonds), eyes (spades), and genitals (clubs). And the rank of the card represented a list of the thirteen body parts. Ace (genitals), 2 (feet), 3 (legs), 4 (butt), 5 (stomach), 6 (lowerback) 7 (chest), 8 (upperback), 9 (arns), 10 (hands) Jack (neck), queen (ears), and King (mouth). Then basically, you would spin the bottle to pick a "victim", and they would have to pick a card. Depending on the suit/rank, they would have to perform the random combination of acts. It was weird when you got the 6 of hearts and had to kiss someone's ass. But every guy wanted the ace of clubs. :-)
In college, my friend was driving my car and not paying attention. We got to a T-intersection on the highway, and he looked up at the last minute. "Shit, where'd the road go???" was the last thing I heard before we literally flew off the end of the road. There was a 45 degree embankment, and we flew through the tops of several trees before spinning around and landing in a farm field at the bottom. The car was obviously totaled, we climbed out of the windows unscathed. The farmer came out to survey for bodies. It turns out we were the fourth car ever to come down that way, and the first to survive. Edit: More info: To those wondering about the four accidents, yes, there was signage and a guardrail, but we weren't paying attention. The four accidents occurred, according to the farmer, over 26 years, so no immediate demand for marking it better. And, to make matters more unbelievable, the vehicle was a 1980 Ford Pinto. Edit 2: Location. We were approaching highway 4 near Fort Ridgley in Minnesota from the road on the right. You can see that since we went dead on straight ahead, instead of turning toward the right, we missed the road completely and went through the wire barrier and trees to the bottom. here is the view from head-on.
I own my own gym and have for a few years now. I received a message one day from a familiar looking name on the business' Facebook page from a women asking to come try us out. We set it up, she comes in for an introduction, she's a very very large and out of shape woman at this point. After about 5 minutes of working with it her, it hits me that this lady used to be about half her current size and was an absolute b___ in her hay day. I decided not to bring it up to her as she appeared to be struggling in life and came to us in a time of need and I took it, as I do with all of my clients, as a cry for help. Not to mention, I'm a grown man now and that seemed pretty silly and insignificant in life today. Months later during one of the classes, I noticed her struggling real hard so I go over to offer some encouragement. As I leaned down to say something to her, I notice she's crying faintly to herself. She looks up at me and quietly says "Sorry for how nasty I was to you years ago and thank you for doing this for me." Turns out an old mutual friend told her about my place and she recognized me as the owner and came to me on purpose. No, not a story of revenge or retribution, but, she reached out to someone she was terrible to and today, she's re-purposed and I find it to be quite inspiring.
I worked at a major aquarium caring for amphibians, reptiles, and fish. We had piranhas, which normally got along just fine. One time one of them developed an eye infection, and the others started to pick it at. If we had let it go on much longer, I'm pretty sure they would have eaten it. Instead the eye was amputated, and the fish got along just fine. I also cared for an anaconda, and had to feed it once a week. Most of the time, it wasn't too hard to deal with. I would just bring a (thawed) dead rabbit or rat in and hold it outstretched using one of those trash grabbers. The anaconda would come over, coil back for a second, and then strike, taking the food underwater to slowly swallow it. One time the anaconda was preparing to shed (a long process) and its eyes were hazed over and cloudy. When I came in to feed it that week, it came straight at me instead of at the rabbit. It was pretty spooky. I had to basically hit it across the face with the rabbit before it stopped, realized where the food was, and took it.
Ok, I run a website design site. On 2009 February, McAfee’s siteadvisor.com flagged one of my sites as “not safe” and anyone with McAfee virus scanner or toolbar is now told it has a virus and is blocked from visiting it (existing users have emailed me daily about this too). What actually happened is they basically pulled links to all executable files on my hosting. They then run it via their virus scanner with heuristic scanning turned ON. What this basically means is that any file which McAfee scanner "thinks" is a virus is now flagged as one. Anyway, so they found a file on my domain and tagged it as virus called “Search threat library”. Their result is based on guesswork because it says on the page: “In our tests, this download contained programs some people would consider adware, spyware or other potentially unwanted programs.” Thank you, that’s not vague at all! Now the reason I know this file cannot be a virus is because I compiled it myself (with Delphi) and was not a public download either. So, I wrote to them, their support told me they’ll re-scan my website. I waited patiently for weeks but the flag was not removed. Being a small webmaster, I said fuck it and I just deleted the file from my server this time (to a 404 page). Wrote to them again (this was few months ago). They did not even reply this time. I emailed them a few more times to finally get another canned reply that my site will be queued again for scanning. I patiently waited for weeks again but nothing happened. So now I am basically being punished for something I never did and a file which doesn't even exist on my server for the last six months. Then one day it suddenly hit me.. You see the thing is McAfee siteadvisor.com also sells these hacker-safe certificates to websites for $360 / year. With that in picture, this whole fucking thing just makes sense. This is just a ploy to sell those certificates. In internet-speak, this is how it works: * Find and flag random files as a generic virus (based on some guesswork scanning) * Flag the entire domain for hosting viruses and start blocking visitors to it. * Domain owner buys *hacker-safe* certificates for an inane $360/year to get site re-tested. * Profit! My option now is to either buy their $360 hacker-safe badge or keep losing more business everyday.. I’m a small webmaster, even if they turn 10 people away daily, it hurts me bad :( I do not have the resources to hire a lawyer or send them legal notices either. So, I can buy their stupid certificate but I have been waiting patiently since 2009 February to resolve this and being strong armed into buying their stupid certificate after all this time will be so fucking very unfair. So I'm posting here as my last ditch attempt. I'm desperate for ideas, Reddit. What are my options? Please help me.. edit: I can see this on the front page. woohoo! Hopefully someone from McAfee will see it now and reply. Also I don't mind if a blogger wants to contact me for more details to write about this little scam too. I've also emailed all details to AHhHhh_shit and he has also been a lot of help. My site has been listed on McAfee ever since 2009 Feb and finally i'm beginning to see some hope that someone will at least hear my case! Thank you again Reddit for being awesome. edit 2: the editors of two leading tech blogs just contacted me for details last night (replying now). Also, a lot of people have replied (or PMed me) with their own sites and similar stories which only makes me happy that this is finally getting some attention. I wrote to McAfee again (as per turnipsoup's advise) but it will take two business days before we hear from them. I am amazed with the advice and help Reddit has offered me. I will definitely post an update too if something happens. edit 3: my site is finally green again.. woohoo! reddit did it. Everyone who mailed/contacted McAfee on my behalf thank you! I have waited almost an year for this to happen and you guys did it in less than 2 days. I really can't thank you guys enough for your support. I'm feeling very happy and very proud to be a part of this awesome community. This proves that reddit > mcafee.. actually reddit > everything. and redditors are awesome!
This is the original post made by a redditor called Lurial about two years ago. While those cheats may be awesome, it's about time we got some new ones up there and i'm sure there are more than 30 cheat codes we could all use. I've messaged Bacongobbler - A redditor who makes AmA's into comprehensive, easy to read and straightforward lists about doing the same with the cheat codes so they're easier to read. That's about it, I'll start us off: When you go to a restaurant where they bring you your drink in a cup/glass, ask for no ice or for ice on the side. Often what they do is load your drink with ice so that it seems as if there's more in there, especially at bars. When you pour soda, pour it along the side of the cup instead of directly into it - like they do at bars. This keeps alot of the "fizzyness" in the drink and as a result, it keeps a lot of the texture and flavor. If you need to withdraw more money than your limit, if you do it quickly enough, you can withdraw your limit twice from the same ATM and sometimes the one next to it before it stops you from withdrawing any more. Thanks for your submissions! EDIT: Woah! Front page! Bacongobbler replied and said he'd be able to make the list sometime today. Thanks Again Everyone, these are some awesome cheat codes :D EDIT 2: Bacongobbler's put up his easy-to-read version of this post [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uou6z/update_i_was_requested_to_compile_all_of_the/).
Only 52, but still "older" as far as Reddit goes. Technology has affected every area of my life. I grew up WAY out in the wilds of NC, and can remember having a "party line," and how technologically wonderful it was when we got our own phone with no one else using it (and that one was in the kitchen with a long-ass cord). I remember telling my mom one day we wouldn't need money, only a card like the one she used at the gas station, and she laughed and laughed, and said I should quit watching so much Star Trek. Best day ever was when I gave her a cell phone (she became addicted to it). Biggest technology wonders in my 52 years, definitely communications. Work has changed dramatically... I started as a medical receptionist and learned an antique, handwritten system for keeping track of the money (in 1979), and the last system I learned was a completely comprehensive computer system that kept track of everything, and I mean EVERYTHING...I love it all, especially the internet. Hell, just being able to answer your question is marvelous. How has technology affected me? It's kept me sharp, kept me informed, and mostly, it's kept me in touch with the world (albeit, Reddit can be a pretty strange world.
And also, advice from Ladies whose Fathers failed in this area. What actions / habits should I work most to avoid? I'm also open to advice from other Fathers who maintain strong relationships with their little girls. I just want to be the best Daddy I can be. Thanks EDIT #1- Wow! I'm blown away by all of your responses. Thank you all for the detailed and incredible stories and advice. It's going to take me a while to read through them all but I promise that I will read EVERY SINGLE ONE. I'm also journaling the common high points and tidbits that really stand out to me. I feel hearing your perspectives will greatly help me be the best Father I can be to my daughter. I'm a man and my mind works like a man! Hearing from all of you gives me insight that I could never have otherwise. I feel like I'm able to look behind the curtain right now! Thank you again! EDIT #2- I am still reading! If you take the time to comment on this post, I guarantee you I will read it. It may take me a day or two, but I will. I'm keeping this thread forever. Now I'm off to pick my little girl up from school. I have a 10 month old little boy too. I work long days so that I can take off on Fridays and keep him (just me and him). I also did this with my little girl until she started school this year. Anyway, I'm getting ready to take my little girl out on a daddy daughter date. We are going to go see record Wreck it Ralph (she's been asking for months!) and probably go eat some ice cream or something :-)
I am 33 years old and still, to this day, look up to my father. He is amazing and we still talk almost everyday. Over the years I have thought a lot about why we are so close and I think there are a few reasons. My Dad included me in his activities. When my older brother bought a 66 Mustang to restore, I was about 7 and my Dad made sure I was in the garage learning how to change spark plugs and oil. We watched basketball games together and he showed me how to paint model cars. He never felt that because I was a girl I couldn't interact with him on a hobby level. He also, though, listened to and appreciated what I liked. I was in ballet for 13 years, and he was always at every recital, cheering me on. He wrote notes and left them in my lunch. He rarely yelled at me, but I knew when I disappointed him because he would look down, sadly, and say nothing. That was the worst. But the biggest thing is how he treated my mom, and still does. He adores my mom. He opens doors for her, he still brings her flowers, and I loved how he was with my mom. He always just seemed so natural in everything he did. He got colon cancer in 05 and it was devastating for me. It was long while he went through chemo, etc, but he is alive and well now. Looking back, I love that my Dad always respected me, even when I was young. Never treated me as a lesser. Rambled, but hope that helps. I have two daughters of my own, and I love watching my husband have his father-daughter relationships with them!
I'll tell my awkward story. I was a customer. My wife had just had a horrible miscarriage. She had been bleeding horribly for days and finally went the hospital to have a D and C. So afterward my wife sent me to go get underwear because she had ruined all of hers. So the nearest place I can find is Victoria secret. I was trying to figure out number size compared to letter size and looking through the cotton panties when the sales person comes up and asked if I needed help. I explain that I'm trying to find something for my wife and am trying to figure out sizes. She then truss to be helpful and leads me to the sexy underwear. Now this had been our fifth miscarriage. It was by far the worst because of how far along we were. I had always shown very little emotion because I needed to be the rock for my wife who struggled a lot. So when she tried to turn me from what I was doing, no matter how well intentioned, something snapped. I just started to tell her what was going on and tears started to well up and before you know it I was sobbing. I'm 6'5" and barrel chested. Most people assumed I was a biker at the time because of my beard. So there, sitting on the floor, on a pool of his own tears is this gigantic man in the middle of a bunch of lingerie. The poor girl was freaking out like she had done the worst thing in the world and got a manager.
I attended the season finale in 2011 with Timberlake and Gaga. If you've never gone, I'd highly recommend trying to get tickets if you're in New York. Even if you're not normally a fan of SNL, it's a pretty cool experience. First and foremost, the atmosphere is completely different than sitting in your living room. Everything is immediately funnier, and because you're laughing along with an entire crowd, it all seems hilarious. The cast doesn't realize how unfunny they sometimes are. In between scenes, it's very very busy. There's stage hands, makeup, cast members, and techs all running around to get it ready for air. It's a live show, no delays, so everything needs to be done quickly and efficiently. It really is a well oiled machine. Through the magic of television as well, the studio looks a lot larger on TV than it really is. The main train station set is in the middle. The musical guest's set is to the left, and there's a set to the right that's more semi permanent. It's used only once or twice during the show, as they usually make a mess there (note: this is the only place Chris Farley was allowed to perform). The majority of scenes are done in front of the train station set, with different backgrounds carried in. This is also where Weekend Update is done, as well as why the credits sequence is so long: they have to move the set from the dry open sketch before the monologue starts.
Relationship hacks: When she's not around, go check the labels on her shoes, shirts, pants, bra, and underwear. Measure one of her necklaces to see what length she likes. Pocket one of her rings, take it to a jeweler and have them tell you what size it is. Write all of these sizes down. At some point she will ask you to buy tampons for her. It happens. When you go to the store, buy 3 small packages of her brand. Give her one and hide the other two in your car (near the spare tire, she'll never look there). Next time she asks you to buy her some you can just go to the bar and have a beer instead of actually going to the store. Never buy a diamond. Cubic zirconia and moissanite look just as good, and man-made diamonds are getting easier to find every year. Edit: To clarify #3, there doesn't need to be any deception. It's just stupid to pay $1500 for a worthless rock. Go buy a $300 ring, propose, if she says yes then tell her that you bought a ring with a synthetic stone because you don't enjoy funding civil wars. If you still feel the obligation to verify your love with a poor financial decision, give her a $1200 gift certificate to a bridal store. Edit2: I thought of another one: 4) If your SO likes to spoon, but you're not in the mood to cuddle with a thermonuclear device, just follow wreckemtech's handy MS Paint guide to Faux Spooning. If you're still too hot, stick your free foot out of the covers. She'll think you were snuggling all night, when really you were sleeping comfortably, or possibly laying there trying to estimate your heat transfer coefficient.
My Netflix Instant account was hacked two years ago, but the person left the password unchanged, and used the account in secret. A little later I realized because of all the 'recently watched' was none of my movies. Ever since then this man/woman and I have been adding things to the que so the other can watch it. We put in movies and let the other rate it, the rating is like our way of saying wether we liked the movie or not. The person has never contacted me. I assume he/she has my email though, because they hacked my account. I am content going the rest of my life never seeing or talking to this person. I have this picture of them in my head, I don't want to be dissapointed. Maybe you had a long conversation with a wrong number or a crazy omegle story. Anything! edit: Wow guys this is beyond me how this thread made it to the front page. Never thought this story would be that interesting, guess I was wrong. I never really thought about changing the password, that would just ruin the fun! No, I haven't been contacted by anyone serious. Must not be a redditor. Thanks fellow humans of reddit for the front page, cheers!
The organization I work for is one of the largest employers in the country, their annual profits (public information) could fund a small country, or purchase half of Africa, for obvious reasons that is all I'm going to say to indicate the scale of this matter. A few months ago, a form circulated through nearly every major department. We were given no explanation on what this form was for, even when asking managers etc. Their responses were always vague and something along the lines of "it's for training purposes." I tried to politely decline filling out one of these forms which required all kinds of personal information but was told in no uncertain terms "I had to" - now I know in a perfect world I would have stuck it to the man, but I have rent to pay and I get dizzy if I don't eat at least twice every 24 hours. First world problems! Today, the reason we were "forced" to sign this form became apparent (to me at least) - a small group of employees from my department were invited into a room to complete the aforementioned "training." Now this training was supposed to have taken place over a period of months - which they illegally back dated all the paper work to reflect. A facilitator was supposed to monitor and observe our competencies and have us complete a number of practical tasks as well as fill out some written short answer questions, multiple choice, standard stuff. Instead, they had us fraudulently complete the assessments by feeding us the answers, filling in all the sections with competent where the trainer should have, place back dates and numerous other fallacies all over this thing, and then sign, date it and hand it back like it was nothing to worry about. Here is the kicker, for every hour spent by this imaginary facilitator over the imaginary period of imaginary months, observing us and training us to be competent in this particular area, they are receiving government funding, subsidization and kick backs. Now don't get me wrong I know it's pretty commonplace for corporations to make their training "fool proof" pad it out and do some spoon feeding. But straight up lying and then making your employees a party to it, all under the guise of something very vague in an environment where major line managers are there and it's unbelievably uncomfortable to be the guy who says "Hey, something is not right here" - which I did at stage 1 on multiple occasions only to be shot down is not something anyone should have to endure in a professional environment. I'm kind of at a loss as to what I should do, am I over reacting and being an asshat about this? I consider myself to be a more or less good person, I value morals, you can sugar coat it and say who cares or whatever but at the end of the day, this is pure and simple. A massive corporation fraudulently acquiring government kickbacks, which taxpayers then have to foot the bill for, when said company already makes squillions more than necessary for any one to be happy with. I feel like I've been made an accessory to some greedy low act and I am not happy about it. I don't know whether to try and ask someone about it, I have a feeling that would go badly. I could try to deal with it internally, I also have a feeling that would go very badly, and know from experience that it has for others in the past. Or I could go to an independent watchdog type organization and become a full on whistleblower.... Conflicted, help me reddit, what do? This is not sitting right with me at all. PS. Did some very approximate number crunching based on the limited information that I do have for sure, if they did this with all the staff in my department alone which is a small fragment of the total organization, they would stand to gain in excess of $1.7million in tax payer funds. Multiply that out across the entire organization, I cringe at the very idea of what that final number would be.
EDIT: Dammit, you're Australian? Well they probably have similar laws there. Also, if they are an international corporation (listed on a US stock exchange), these laws might help you a bit anyhow. And here is some Australian-specific info that might help you. It's probably still worth it to get a lawyer. EDIT: Please read all the comments. There are a lot of things to consider before you blow the whistle, and the fact is that no one knows whether reporting will help you or hurt you. The info I give you is solely to inform your decision. Hi, jrouble. I'm not an expert, but I recently participated in a project on whistleblowers. I am a law student, so I am obligated to say that none of this should be construed as legal advice. Here's some useful stuff from the SEC. More from the National Whistleblowers Center. EDIT: The National Whistleblowers Center is a great resource. I suggest you fully explore their website. I'm really hesitant to give you advice because I technically can't. But here's some stuff that I'm pretty sure about.
I've had a horrible helicopter parent week so this thread makes me feel like I'm in good (?) company and am not alone. The power that these parents have in coming into the classroom and changing how things are done is scary. I had 3 kids who were caught turning in the same paper and after giving them zeros for the assignment they got their parents to form a witch hunt. One of the parents rallied all the other parents in the class who all came in to hold a meeting about me and how I teach, even though none of them have been in my class or have talked with me personally. This is a highly advanced class and the LOWEST grade is a C which is really amazing. I'm actually super proud of all of them. Anyway, parents got the administration to have me allow them to redo the paper (essentially showing that I have zero authority for grades or to uphold high standards) AND I now must be extra evaluated because of the things these parents say I do in my class. Meanwhile I still have to teach these kids and act as a professional toward them, which I will. This behavior is unacceptable as a parent.
I was fishing with my Dad off the coast of Mallorca in Spain when I was about 15. It was really warm and we weren't catching anything much, so we got some snorkels and went for a swim around to see if we could see anything interesting, ( it was only about 20 feet deep). Around these cave-like rocks I spotted what looked like a dead body. I started trying to dive down, but I'm not a super strong swimmer so when I would get to about 10 feet away from it I would have to come back up for air. Eventually my Dad gets to it and I was diving and watching and diving and watching, thinking fuck fuck fuck fuck.... And he was wriggling a rock trying to free it. It starts to float towards the surface and my Dad follows. Right in front of my face a half melted slimy life size plastic Santa bobs out of the water. Weird thing is I'm not sure Spanish people even really have santa as part of their christmas decorations. I'm glad I was in the sea because I'm pretty sure I peed my pants. My Dad thought it was hilarious. He put melty-dead-guy-Santa in to the boat to show my mom. About a week later I woke up and it was in my bed.
I'm not an American, but I'd like to offer a European perspective, and maybe explain why our reaction to the Pledge ranges from mild discomfort through disgust to outright horror. It comes down to the distinction between patriotism and nationalism. It's not news that there is a fine line between these two ideologies, but what seems like patriotism to an American can seem like Nationalism to many Europeans. The thing is, the rise of fascism and the Second World War are still a huge part of the national psyche for most European nations, not to mention the Soviet era. Of course, America suffered in the war too, and I don't want to downplay that. But America didn't have foreign troops occupying its mainland, didn't have bombs dropping on its cities, didn't have its political institutions subverted into dictatorship. Americans saw the concentration camps as the 3rd Reich fell, but didn't see their neighbours being dragged into the street, or feel the broken glass crunch under their feet. Even though only the older generation has first-hand recollection of these things, we are all powerfully aware of them. Most of Europe has an ingrained horror of anything resembling fascism or nationalism. There is an unspoken fear that what happened before could somehow happen again.
