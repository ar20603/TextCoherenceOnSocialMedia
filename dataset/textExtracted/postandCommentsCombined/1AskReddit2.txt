I decided to post this partially because I'm interested in reaction to this (as I've never told anyone before) and also to see what out-there fucked up things you've done. The sort of things that make you question your own sanity, your own worth. Surely I can't be alone. 40,700 comments, 12,900 upvotes. You're all a part of Reddit history right here.

I'm reading every single comment, so keep those juicy secrets coming. ^edit2: Man some of you are fucked up. That's awesome. A lot of you seem to be contemplating suicide too, that's not as awesome. In fact... kinda not awesome at all. Go talk to someone, and get help for that shit. The rest of you though, fuck man. Fuck. ^edit3: Well, this has blown up. The #3 post of all time on Reddit. I hope you like your dirty laundry aired. Cheers everyone.Two and a half years ago I was in dire financial straights, so I sold my home to keep my struggling business afloat. I neglected to tell the owners that they have an 800 sq. ft. bunker on the property that I built about seven years ago. The bunker that I've called home since I sold it. The entrance to it is well-hidden, but I still come and go very early/very late in the day. I'm a single man who keeps to himself. I'm now in a situation where I could move somewhere else, but I love this hidden paradise so much.Can you post a pic of the bunker? I kinda want to see what it looks likeThat is so. fucking. awesome.So I'm assuming you're stealing their wifi right now?

The pump handle on the icon will be on the side of the tank. Update: saw the gas tank one on an older reddit, turns out the handle thing is not consistant. But there IS usually a little arrow next to the icon. Second Update 99% of the time the gas door is opposite of the tailpipe. So far, I have only found that early-mid 2000 Pontiac Vibes break this trend. Third update if there is no arrow, then it most likely is on the passenger's side. I've yet to see one without an arrow that wasn't on the passenger's side #22 Permalink this tip was unpopular, so im changing it This one changed my life.

The fine for this offense (at the university I worked at) was $250, and usually a ban from parking at the university (i.e., booted or towed on sight). College Parking Cheat Code: Anyone who's gone to a college or university knows they usually charge a ridiculous amount of money for parking (usually $300+ for a semester pass or $10+ for the daily passes), a service that should fucking be free for students considering the high cost of education. Fuck them. Buy one daily pass at the beginning of the school year (usually a small paper ticket printed out a machine on the lot), take it home and scan it, photoshop the date for tomorrow, and print. Repeat for the next 4 years. Anyone with even the most rudimentary photoshop skills can pull this off convincingly. Even if your printer is shitty, from behind the tint and glare of a car windshield, it might as well be a 7-11 receipt. I did this for 2 years at a UC and saved hundreds of dollars. The new list of real-life cheat codes based on the top scoring comments from both the new list created by MrCassiBro and the old list Number Cheat #31 Permalink When you go to a restaurant where they bring you your drink in a cup/glass, ask for no ice or for ice on the side. Often what they do is load your drink with ice so that it seems as if there's more in there, especially at bars. #32 Permalink When you pour soda, pour it along the side of the cup instead of directly into it - like they do at bars. This keeps alot of the "fizzyness" in the drink and as a result, it keeps a lot of the texture and flavor. #33 Permalink If you need to withdraw more money than your limit, if you do it quickly enough, you can withdraw your limit twice from the same ATM and sometimes the one next to it before it stops you from withdrawing any more. #34 Permalink If you back up the toilet at work or someones house with no plunger available, look for liquid hand soap. Dump some in the toilet and wait about five minutes and flush again. The soap lubricates the nasties so they'll flush away. If its still clogged, find a way to dump hot water in the toilet, as it can have the same effect. Use the trash can or something. If its still clogged, kick the door open and run like hell. Find a new job or new friends. You just left their toilet full of hot soapy shit soup, you asshole. #35 Permalink When I am in a large shopping centre (mall) I take a photo of the information board on my phone so I can look up how to get to stores without having to go back to the board #36 Permalink When commenting on something, whether it be reddit, facebook, etc. finish typing your comment, stop, re-read it twice and then ask yourself what you are trying to accomplish with said comment before posting. #37 Permalink When you finish showering, use your hand as a squeegee(?) To get excess water off your body. It makes drying much faster and your towel will also be dry sooner. #38 Permalink Don't be a dick #39 Permalink if you gently rock back and forth while pooping it will take significantly less time and make it easier to pass more "troublesome" movements. Best. Lifehack. Ever. #40 Permalink Try and get in good with the clerks/secretaries of where ever you work or do business. Those are the people who can most easily cover your ass when you fuck up. #50 Permalink 1st Date Cheat Code for MEN: Never tell a girl where you’re going or how to dress. Instead, tell her to "dress for a first date with a guy she really likes". Now, pick three places you'd like to go: someplace fun and active (bowling, pool, mini golf, go-kart racing, ballgame, etc), something romantic and classy (nice restaurant, upscale lounge, art gallery opening) and something in between (nice bar, coffee shop, comedy club). Now, when you pick her up, let the way she's dressed decide which you’re going to do: If she's wearing something sexy and revealing (dress, high heels, low cut top, etc.) than she wants to go somewhere classy and romantic. If she's sporting some jeans, tennis shoes or flip-flops, and a tee, the bowling ally or pool hall may be a good bet. If she's wearing jeans, high heeled boots, and nice top or blouse, than she's not really jonesing for the super romance treatment, and she put in more effort than mini golf deserves (eighteen holes of mini golf in heels... seriously?), so a comedy club or some place with live music is a good choice. And never, EVER, do a movie on the first date! EDIT: Men: You're going to wear a pair of CLEAN, NEAT jeans, a pressed stylish LONG sleeve button down shirt, nice shoes or boots (try to avoid tennis shoes of sneakers). Works for ANY occasion! #51 Permalink If you don't know if a baby is a boy or a girl ask the baby "Whats your name?" And the parent will answer. That way no angry mom or dad getting mad because you cant tel because they dress there baby in green. #52 Permalink Wear a condom #53 Permalink On flights, if you are fighting for an arm rest with a stranger. bring your arm (the one thats on the same side the arm rest you want) up to your mouth and sneeze/cough. Then place it by the armrest. The other person will move their arm. Has had 100% success rate. #53 Permalink To stop a sneeze, tickle the roof of your mouth with your tongue. #55 Permalink Avoid forgetting something in the morning by placing it in your shoes. (works best if you wear the same pair every day.) #56 Permalink Give yourself half an hour of downtime in the morning, between being ready to leave and leaving, and your day won't feel so rushed. #57 Permalink Simply put: Don't ever overlay your reality onto someone else's reality. Example: Person A: "Oh man, I'm having a really hard time recently, I can't seem to get along with my mom." Person B: "Yeah, I know how that is, I just talked to my mom yesterday, and she was like...." etc. Let Person A reflect on their moment of hardship, stand back, listen, be there for them, but don't interject with your own thoughts/emotions about your own situation. #58 Permalink When you're talking to someone and can't tell if they are interested in the subject/their mind is elsewhere, cross your arms. If they cross theirs as well, they are truly listening. #59 Permalink Men of all shapes and sizes: Wear clothing that fits. Nothing looks trashier than a guy wearing a shirt two sizes too big or a pair of uncomfortable looking pants. This applies to fat guys too, don't try to hide your flub by wearing large t-shirts and jackets as they only make you look bigger! Instead get fitted and wear clothing that fits you. #60 Permalink Listen to music when doing stuff by yourself, it will make the most mundane task feel awesome. #61 Permalink If you want to get into a sold out concert simply go to the store and buy two bags of ice. Walk up to the front of the line and say, "I'm the ice guy". Free concert, minus the price of the ice. #62 Permalink If you are quitting something e.g. smoking, drinking etc. Everytime you feel the urge to do said addiction : Go for a run, do 20 sit ups, 20 push ups etc. This way you can start to associate exercise with quitting and you get fitter the more you quit which can make you feel better #63 Permalink Shut the fuck up. Wait for the lawyer. #64 Permalink No matter where you are in public, make it a habit of noting every reflective surface around you. Usually you can find one that gives a decent view of who is behind you. If you're at work, strategically place cds or other reflective objects so you can always see whose standing behind you in your cube. #65 Permalink ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A Start #66 Permalink Don't waste money buying expensive binoculars. Simply stand closer to the object you wish to view. #67 Permalink Before you take a dookie, throw in a piece or two of toilet paper in the toilet bowl to reduce/avoid splasing and that kerplunk noise. #68 Permalink Women can push the poop out with their fingers properly inserted into their vagina. #69 Permalink If you're shaving your balls, try to maintain an erection during the entire shave. The whole job is a lot easier with your penis out of the way. #70 Permalink If you have crushing chest pain, call 911 first. Then chew some aspirin. I work in cardiology. #71 Permalink When you eat hard shell taco's, do it over your nachos. That way when they disintegrate, you can eat the bits you lost with your nachos. #72 Permalink If you need to store cookies or pastries for a few days in a tupperware or other type of container, to prevent them from getting dry and brittle, put a piece of bread in the container right along with the cookies. It will keep them very soft and moist. Sometimes, if you burn the cookies a little and they seem very tough and crunchy, leaving them in a container with the bread over night will actually soften them up and make them better than when they came out of the oven! #73 Permalink Kill a boner within 30 seconds by squeezing your thighs together really tight. (Guys only). #74 Permalink Walk on the sides of stairs to avoid/reduce creaks. #75 Permalink Talk to everyone like you would your best mate, and smile. #76 Permalink Sprinkle some salt on your napkin coaster at the bar.. your beer won't stick to it EVERY FUGGIN TIME.... #77 Permalink To get through tech support quickly with an ISP, choose the option for becoming a new customer. Then when you get there ask to transfer to tech support. Usually they won't put you on hold because they see the number coming from the new customer line. #78 Permalink Pull on your hair in the shower, if it squeaks you already shampooed it. #79 Permalink Don't announce that you are having a kid till the second trimester. #80 Permalink When studying arts at university, take notes on your prof's political/philosophical ideologies and worldviews. Regurgitate in essays and on exams for an A grade. Also, margins, font, font size, etc. are incredibly important. Never neglect these. #81 Permalink Never include #41-#49 in a list of real-life cheat codes on reddit. Some things to remember: If you liked a tip, upvote its original author. It's only fair.

I also take a pic of my car keys in my hand next to my valet ticket that I will soon lose.
I like the one about the Rugrats. Ever wondered just how Angelica could talk to the babies? Angelica is the only one who can talk to the babies because they are a figment of her imagination. She is spoilt, sad and lonely, because her Mother is constantly working and has no time for her. Her relationship with her Dad is superficial and unsubstantial, no real love is ever shown to her. So how did it come about that Angelica would have to imagine these babies? Tommy died soon after child birth, a fact reflected by Stu never leaving the basement, inventing toys that his son will never play with. Chuckie died in the car crash along with his Mum, also reflected in the actions of his father; the crash has made him a pathetic nervous wreck most of the time. Most interesting is Phil and Lil. There never where any twins, there was just one baby. However this baby was a still born, and Angelica never knew the sex of the still born, so she invented twins of different genders. Sadly, Angelica never uses her imaginary friends to comfort or entertain her, instead she is mean and nasty to them. She has invented this relationship with these babies so she can vent her frustrations of being a spoilt, lonely brat who has seen much hardship from these unfortunate parents; frustrations that can't be satisfied by a typical childhood relationship with a doll, albeit a Cynthia one. EDIT: Wow. Went to bed and there was about 25 upvotes. Woke up and now there's quite a lot more, and a subreddit created! Great success! Will read them all, goosebumps will be had. And I know that the majority of these theories aren't water-tight (including mine...), but come on, it's fun to speculate! EDIT II: I have realized how my question could be interpreted the wrong way, hence numerous and humorous links to this. Indeed, my mind is blown. EDIT III: OK I'm heading off now, and by the time I get back this thread will have disappeared into the depths of Askreddit. Thanks for the amazing response! I know my theory was rubbish, but there are some absolutely amazing ones, my favorite being the Kill Bill one. Bill is not dead!. Don't forget to check out and post in /r/fantheories!I read a theory about Courage the Cowardly Dog that said that Courage is actually a normal dog and he sees the world through a dog's eyes. All the villains in the show are just normal people, but to a little dog they seem scary. They don't actually live in the middle of Nowhere, but since his owners are too old to take him outside for walks, he only knows what's around his immediate property, and everything beyond that is nothing because he's never seen it.This is a good theory. Also explains why Courage always feels like he has to "protect" his owners from all the scary things, even though the owners are very nonchalant about all of the situations, and act like everything is normal and Courage is freaking out for apparently no reason.Good theory, I think that was sort of evident, if I recall correctly some of the villians were doctors (veterinarians) and such
For clarification: http://www.eurodezigns.com/images/ligthts-on.jpgSo a little of a personal story here. I happen to have a very common hispanic name, also I served in the Marines who on two different occasions lost personal information of mine to include my social security number. The state of Florida was able to pull $25K out of my personal bank account with only my very common last name and social. It was for someone trying to collect way past due child support. Neither Florida Child Support Collections or Bank of America bothered to check the first or middle name on the account. Much less the birthday, residence, or any other personal information. This all happened with out any notification. All the sudden I had nothing in my account, and it was up to me to figure out how to live for the next 3 months while BOA and Florida unfucked my shit. I realize its hard to pin down some of these worthless child support dodging assholes, but that does not mean that you can just remove funds from an account without matching every detail. Fortunately I have friends and family who helped me get a lawyer, and float me some money until all of this was figured out. However without them, I would have been up shit creek without a paddle. Sorry for the long story. Edit: Spelling
Obviously im going to use one. Back in highschool i dated a girl for 6 months before she decided it wasn't working out anymore and she cheated on me with about 6 guys and stole my iPhone and wallet to buy drugs. I wanted to report her to the police like my parents encouraged me to and to prevent me from doing such her brother jumped me while I was walking home with his friends and busted open my lip pretty badly and threatened to kill me if i reported him or his sister (this is South Florida, so i believed he would do it). My dad got a new job and we moved to a new city but i was still pissed about this whole situation so i did the next best thing. I created two fake facebook account of a random hot girl and guy, spent some time making it look legit with friends and such and added her brother on facebook with the girl and my ex with the guy. It wasnt too long before he started flirting "me" up and tried his best to get in this girls pants. on the other hand, having already courted my now ex i knew exactly what to say to charm her to the point that she was in love with me. This is where it all begins to get fun. I started a sexting relationship between the brother and sister with me as the intermediate thanks to google voice. Both of them had fairly typical south florida bodies so nothing really gave anything away and i did a fair amount of photoshopping to remove identifiers in the room that may give away anything. This went on for about a month and a half totaling about 200 or so nudes between the two of them when i decided to reveal the curtain and send a group of unedited pictures that included key identifiers (face and rooms). Oh holy jesus how shit went down. I only wish i had some way to see how they reacted. Friends who still lived there told me her brother moved in with his dad that week and that they no longer spoke. All in all, about 4 months till i got my revenge but it was amazing. EDIT: YOU GODDAMN SONS OF BITCHES. Someone told my Ex about it and now she finally knows forsure that it was me. HAHAHAH. Sucks for her i now live 2000 miles away for college but jesus christ reddit. Dont go shooting your mouth off.Friend and I were fishing at a local creek when my friends brother pulled up. Being the dick he normally was he started throwing rocks in the creek to scare the fish and then he threw my friends bike in the creek. We were 13 at the time, my friend was crying and I felt so bad. I jumped into the creek and got his bike out, told him we would get his brother back. About a month later we were fishing again and it was the dead of summer. I told my friend today is the day we get his brother back. Caught a 2/3 pound carp, threw it up on the side of the bank and left it there until we were done fishing. At the end of the night went back to his place his brothers car was sitting on the street, we took the carp sliced it open and threw it under the drivers seat and rolled his windows 3/4 up. The next morning when we woke and left I forgot about what we had done. Well when I rode past JT's car I noticed the window was kind of black and then I took a closer look it was covered in flies. I actually got scared because I did not expect to a window caked with flies. By the time I got home I was laughing in tears because his brother was always such a dick to us. Fast forward to baseball practice about 3 days later, friend had a black eye but smiled at me when we made eye contact. His brother flipped out and ran into his house and punched him in the face. His mom flipped out on his brother, brother was grounded for the rest of summer. His mom said that my friend would never do such a thing and he played along and acted as if he had no idea. Apparently the smell never really left the car. We nicknamed his brother lord of the flies.
Edit: (Woah obligatory front page) Thanks chefs, cooks and homecookers- lots of great tips! Here are some of the top tips: Use good tools- Things are better and easier when you use good pans and knives. Whenever you're sautéing, frying, or wok-ing don't crowd the pan. Prep all of your stuff before starting to cook. Read the whole recipe before you begin cooking. Meat continues cooking after you take it off the grill Butter Awesome steak technique from ironicouch "My friend's mother taught me how to cook steak a few months back, so far it has not failed me. You have to make sure your steak is dry, use a paper towel to dry it off. Heat the skillet before putting the steak on, you want to hear it sizzle when you place it in the pan. Rub the steak down with just a little olive oil and some sea salt and then place it in the pan for until it starts browning, so it doesn't take long on the stove, then put in the oven at 400 degrees F, for 10 minutes or even less depending on how rare you like it. Everyone has their own method, but this was the simplest way I have heard it being made, and it always tastes fantastic." Another great steak cooking tip from FirstAmendAnon "Alright, this is a great method, but leaves out a few important details. Here's the skinny on getting you perfect steakhouse quality steaks at home: Buy a thick cut of meat like a porterhouse. If its more than 2" thick it's usually better. Look for a lot of marbling (little white lines of fat through the meat). The more the better. Stick the meat unwrapped on a rack in the fridge overnight (watch out for cross-contamination! make sure your fridge is clean). This ages the meat and helps dry it out. Then like an hour before you cook take it out of the fridge, pat it down with paper towels, and leave it out until your ready to season. Preheat your oven to really hot, like 500F, and stick your (ovensafe!) pan in there. That will ensure your pan is super hot and get a sear on your meat quickly. Season both sides of the steak with coarse salt and like a teaspoon of oil. I find peanut oil to be better than olive oil but it doesn't really make much difference. Pan out of the oven using a thick oven mitt. Stick your steak in there, it should hiss loudly and start to sear immedietly. This is the goodness. 2 minutes on both sides, then stick about three tablespoons of room temperature butter and three sprigs of fresh rosemary on top of the steak and throw that baby in the oven. after about 3 minutes, open the oven (there will be lots of smoke, run your fan), and flip the steak. 2 or three more minutes, pull it out. If you like it more on the well done side, leave it a little longer. Do not leave it for more than like 5 minutes because you might as well just make hamburgers. Take it off the heat. Using a wooden spoon or large soup spoon tilt the pan and repeatedly spoon the butter and juices onto the steak. Baste in all its glory. Let the meat rest for about five minutes. I use that time to make the plate prettified. Mash potatoes or cheesy grits on the bottom. Brussel sprouts on the side. Maybe some good goats cheese on top of the steak. Be creative. This method is guaranteed to produce a bomb diggity steak. Like, blowjob-inducing 100% of the time. It's really high-heat and ingredient driven though, so be careful, and spend that extra $5 on the good cut of meat. EDIT: As a couple of people below have mentioned, a well-seasoned cast iron pan is best for this method. Also, the 5th bullet is slightly unclear. You take the hot pan out of the oven, place it on the stovetop with the stovetop on full heat, and sear the steak for 2min ish on both sides. Then cut off the stovetop and put the steak in the oven."Whatever you're sautéing, don't crowd the pan. Get a bigger pan or cook in batches but the reason your potatoes/veggies/etc. aren't getting brown and crispy is because they're drowning in their own juice.I can confirm this. I am not getting a tan because I keep drowning in my own juices. SOURCE: Is a Potatojust to clarify, they are doing nothing but giving up juice because the excess food has brought the temp of the pan down too low. another tip to help this, naturally, is to try not to use really cold ingredients like steak right out of the fridge.A falling knife has no handle.
If you have no idea what I'm talking about: Original Post from three months ago and Update 1. HuffPo Writeup TLDR: I traveled. Reddit gave me things to do. I did them Hey Reddit, I've had a crazy, crazy summer and have you guys to thank. My travels brought me across the US and Canada, through rural Thailand, to Seoul and Sydney. Over the last three months I have met hundreds of redditors and gone on some cool adventures. Highlights include: Carwashing for oliversmom - you can read more about Oliver here Mr. Duck Stickers left everywhere Portrait painted Help a dude move Barcraft, Seattle Weeding (Zajoba pictured) Aerial Tour, Seattle Motion Capture for Valve Ride an Elephant Teaching English, Thailand GSL Code S Final, Seoul Tastosis signatures for Redditor John the Translator Picture for a redditor couple Interview Moving a couch: hardmode, Denver Giant spiders in Australia Pubcrawl, Sydney Forensics guest lecture, Sydney Toured the NYSE Rocket Museum, Huntsville Rappeling Eat a "Gripper", Calgary Attend the 100th Calgary Stampede (also, barcraft) Waterfight, Calgary Bobsledding, Calgary Letters, Edmonton (yet to be delivered) Originally I was planning on traveling through till the end of July but surprise tooth ache had me grounded early (turns out I need my wisdom teeth removed). I've been home for the last week, catching up on sleep and getting organized for the upcoming school year (which starts next week). I also donated the money I raised (via reddit) for filming costs since I managed to stay underbudget all trip (mainly by living off of the hospitality of redditors instead of staying in hostels). I'm interested in doing something similar next summer, but on a bigger scale/actually organized. Something where you could vote on where to send me a on week to week basis. In the mean time I'm going to work on turning the footage I took this summer into something (short documentary or music video or something). I just wanted to thank everyone once again, -Daniel / 'Reddit Travel Guy' EDIT: I'll be doing an AMA this Sunday starting at noon PST Obligatory link to the subreddit I kept Preview of footage from thailandI declare you the Most Interesting Man on Reddit.I don't always travel the world, but when I do I help ALL the redditors.What was the best thing that happened to you on your journey?The re-occuring extreme hospitality of people I met. I slept on the couches/spare beds/floors of complete strangers at least 10 times and not once had a bad experience. Four different people offered me use of their cars. And there was free beer.When people my age (oldish) start complaining about young people, I will tell them about you and your use of technology and communication, and hopefully give them the hope for the future that you have given me. Thank you.
So I've been watching HBO's Rome and Generation Kill simultaneously and it's lead me to fantasize about traveling back in time with modern troops and equipment to remove that self-righteous little twat Octavian (Augustus) from power. Let's say we go back in time with a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), since the numbers of members and equipment is listed for our convenience in this Wikipedia article, could we destroy all 30 of Augustus' legions? We'd be up against nearly 330,000 men since each legion was comprised of 11,000 men. These men are typically equipped with limb and torso armor made of metal, and for weaponry they carry swords, spears, bows and other stabbing implements. We'd also encounter siege weapons like catapults and crude incendiary weapons. We'd be made up of about 2000 members, of which about half would be participating in ground attack operations. We can use our four Abrams M1A1 tanks, our artillery and mechanized vehicles (60 Humvees, 16 armored vehicles, etc), but we cannot use our attack air support, only our transport aircraft. We also have medics with us, modern medical equipment and drugs, and engineers, but we no longer have a magical time-traveling supply line (we did have but the timelords frowned upon it, sadly!) that provides us with all the ammunition, equipment and sustenance we need to survive. We'll have to succeed with the stuff we brought with us. So, will we be victorious? I really hope so because I really dislike Octavian and his horrible family. Getting Atia will be a bonus. Edit - Prufrock451 Big thanks to Prufrock451 for bringing this scenario to life in a truly captivating and fascinating manner. Prufrock clearly has a great talent, and today it appears that he or she has discovered that they possess the ability to convey their imagination - and the brilliant ideas it contains - to people in a thoroughly entertaining and exciting way. You have a wonderful talent, Prufrock451, and I hope you are able to use it to entertain people beyond Reddit and the internet. Thank you for your tremendous contribution to this thread. Mustard-Tiger Wow! Thank you for gifting me Reddit Gold! I feel like a little kid who's won something cool, like that time my grandma made me a robot costume out of old cereal boxes and I won a $10 prize that I spent on a Thomas the Tank Engine book! That might seem as if I'm being unappreciative, but watching this topic grow today and seeing people derive enjoyment from all the different ideas and scenarios that have been put forward by different posters has really made my day, and receiving Reddit Gold from Mustard-Tiger is the cherry on the top that has left me feeling just as giddy as that little kid who won a voucher for a bookshop. Again, thank you very much, Mustard-Tiger. I'm sure I will make good use of Reddit Gold. Thank you to all the posters who've recommended books, comics and movies about alternative histories and time travel. I greatly appreciate being made aware of the types of stories and ideas that I really enjoy reading or watching. It's always nice to receive recommendations from people who share your interest in the same things. Edit - In my head the magical resupply system only included sustenance, ammo and replacement equipment like armor. Men and vehicles would not be replaced if they died or were destroyed. I should have made that clear in my OP. Okay, let's remove the magical resupply line, instead replacing it with enough equipment and ammo to last for, say, 6 months. Could we destroy all of the Roman Empire in that space of time before our modern technological advantages ceased to function owing to a lack of supplies? Edit 3 - Perhaps I've over estimated the capabilities of the Roman forces. If we remove the tanks and artillery will we still win? We now have troops, their weapons, vehicles for mobility (including transport helicopters), medics and modern medicine, and engineers and all the other specialists needed to keep a MEU functional.DAY 1 The 35th MEU is on the ground at Kabul, preparing to deploy to southern Afghanistan. Suddenly, it vanishes. The section of Bagram where the 35th was gathered suddenly reappears in a field outside Rome, on the west bank of the Tiber River. Without substantially prepared ground under it, the concrete begins sinking into the marshy ground and cracking. Colonel Miles Nelson orders his men to regroup near the vehicle depot - nearly all of the MEU's vehicles are still stripped for air transport. He orders all helicopters airborne, believing the MEU is trapped in an earthquake. Nelson's men soon report a complete loss of all communications, including GPS and satellite radio. Nelson now believes something more terrible has occurred - a nuclear war and EMP which has left his unit completely isolated. Only a few men have realized that the rest of Bagram has vanished, but that will soon become apparent as the transport helos begin circling the 35th's location. Within an hour, the 2,200 Marines have regrouped, stunned. They are not the only moderns transported to Rome. With them are about 150 Air Force maintenance and repair specialists. There are about 60 Afghan Army soldiers, mostly the MEU's interpreters and liaisons. There are also 15 U.S. civilian contractors and one man, Frank Delacroix, who has spoken to no one but Colonel Nelson.
I just went through the LAX security line with Marilyn Manson. He had "FUCK" scrawled in large letters across the bottom half of his face, with what appeared to be a grease pencil. As we each removed our boots in the security line, he kindly explained that it was not directed at me or anyone else in the airport, but rather at the paparazzi, so that they couldn't sell any photos of him that they took. He was really apologetic about it, and covered his mouth around young children while apologizing to their parents for exposing their child to profanity. Reddit, what weird brief celebrity encounters have you had? Edit: wow. Got on my flight home with 50 upvotes, got off with front page. Cool!A buddy of mine was having a smoke outside a bar near Detroit, when Bruce Campbell strolls by. It's a little after 1 am and he's wearing ray ban shades. One of his friends sheepishly asks "Excuse me, are you Bruce Campbell?". Bruce stops, tips his sunglasses, and responds with "Well, someone's gotta be".Bruce Campbell is fucking awesome.Served Christian Bale a latte at work, he went and stood facing the wall, like a child's punishment until his coffee was ready. People were more bemused by his behaviour, thus giving him slightly more attention.
Today on the train I sat next to a woman who was angry that I sat next to her because she wanted the two seats to herself. As I sat there she kept mouthing under her breath how she just wanted to sit there alone... blah blah blah. Despite the fact that I wanted to tell her that it was public transportation and she needed to get over it I kept my mouth shut. A few minutes later a large woman with a large purse comes and stands in the same car I was in. I get her attention and tell her that she could have my seat. She huffs and puffs her way to me and I help her sit down while grinning at the angry woman who was upset I'd sat beside her. I enjoyed watching her head almost explode from anger as the other large woman's rolls and purse pressed against her for the rest of the ride. Anyone else have any of those subtle revenge stories? Edit: of course the one time I don't check reddit, because I think my story was lame and won't get more than five comments, it takes off. I am looking forward to reading all these stories.... Oh and I'd like to thank all the people that made this possible... my producer, all the guys in Fresno, Melvin, all the haters who said I'd never make it, Phil Collins, OAG, GGG, the White House... yadda yadda yadda... Edit again: This lady is a regular and a known seat hog. I've seen her get into arguments before with people because she wants two seats to herself. Everyone pays to ride the train so if there is a seat open then it's up for grabs.I was working as a manager in a big nightclub about a year ago. I dont wear a uniform, but have a radio and run the security team. The venue has a great smoking section that looks out onto the street. One night the venue was packed so I did my usual roam making sure that there were no problems, however it wasg too packed to walk through the smoking section, so I walked down the street instead, but could still very easily see into the smoking section. One guy stares me down, then calls me over, and starts swearing at me for no reason and telling me that "pieces of shit like you could never even get into a venue like this". He obviously had no idea I was the manager, however I didn't want to have security get into a fight inside with him. The guy kept telling me he would punch me out etc. and was clearly trying to look macho to impress someone. So I agreed and told him to come and meet me outside and he could even have a free swing. He puts his drink down, takes off his jacket and storms outside. Once he walked outside, I walked back inside and told security not to let him back in. The look on his face when he realised I ran the place was priceless, and then the realisation that he couldnt get back into the club was amazing. It was the easiest and most fun removal I have ever done.
Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tenoq/reddit_my_friends_call_me_a_scumbag_because_i/ Okay, the past month and a half has been insane. Like I said in my last post, the code was originally signed to only run on the desktop that I was assigned, and also required a password upon starting. I felt secure in that they couldn't steal and rip the code and fire everyone. I then went to my manager and told him what I was doing. He asked me (In Dutch...) "Is the program still on the work desktop, and did you do it on company time?" I replied yes, and yes. I was promptly fired and expelled from the building. Once I left, I called my bosses superior (? or inferior?? the one higher...) and left him a voice mail saying what happened and that my boss fired me for it, but I thought he was being close minded and not open to advancing the company. I also got a call from my manager, telling me I have to give him the password... I told him I am no longer employed and am not required to any longer. I get a call from my bosses boss, and he asks to have a meeting with me to discuss what actually happened and if it is true that it could save money, he would listen. but I was hellbent on refusing to give out the password. Not to be mean/defensive, but the code was not designed for anyone to use, it was very primitive in the way it had to be setup. I didn't want to be liable for someone using it incorrectly. I met with him a week later, we discussed over tea about the program. I asked if I was doing anything wrong or immoral, and he said that the only issue was that I coded it on company time when I wasn't supposed too, and that the app not only was fine (no requirement to have it done by a person), but also saved the money lots and lots of money and they never even realized it. (They would have had to hire more people to handle the load, but didn't because everything was getting done.) Once we talked about it, he said I was very talented and asked why I worked in the line of work I do instead of software engineering, I replied that I found this job first and was making such great money-- which he didn't expect, and asked me how much I was making, me telling him the true amount. He was floored and cracked up laughing, I made more than my boss (but not the guy I was talking too). He told me he would love to give me a job doing software engineering for the entire companies systems. I agreed only if that the current employees wouldn't be fired and would be put into different places in the company. We came to a compromise that some of the useless people (There were a few...) would be let go (these people are morons beyond belief), but that he could find jobs for the rest (Translation was a big one, since us Dutch people have a culture of learning others languages, sales, HR and other departments, and a few of them were offered training for the jobs. A handful was kept on the original team but their job was changed from manual input to now they work with the tool I built. As far as I know, the bonus program was slashed a lot, but they're still making more bonus than before I bet since I was taking it all) So now I am a lead software engineer over my own department, making the same base pay as I was making base+bonus previously. (No bonus, unfortunately haha) Most other workers moved departments or changed jobs in their department, so most people got a good deal. Except my boss. They were upset with him before this, and were even more upset after him. He was notoriously a bad manager and he was fired over this. Oh well. They hired one of the previous people on my team to take over his job :) TL;DR IT WORKED OUT FOR 99% OF THE PEOPLE. EDIT: one thing is worse: my new desk chair sucksCongratulations! I'm glad you were rewarded for good work, as it should be.This, and THANKS for the update ! I had told your story to many friends as it was a very interesting situation to discuss. I'm glad I'll be able to come up to them with a sequel.I read the first thread and was hoping for an update like this. I run a software company and everything we do is automated, streamlined, automated some more and streamlined some more. If you are ever in London. Send me a PM. I would hire someone based simply on ingenuity and the clear ethics you displayed in protecting your fellow workers. Well done.
EDIT: Plenty of you criticized me for whining. That wasn't my intention - I was genuinely interested in the issues that were limiting the search. If anyone is interested, the replies that I have found best are here: jmking explains how Google has made us take search for granted, and some of the technical limitations. shiningPate shares his interaction with a founder, and a potential reason the search isn't a high priority. Crocodilly_Pontifex goes into detail about some of the stress searching causes a database. TheAmbiguityBuster claims inaccurate post titles hinder the search, and a tagging system could help. Cthulhus_Brother (among many others) share how to utilize Google as a Reddit search. SearchReddit was mentioned a few times, and in the limited testing I've done today, seems like it works pretty well.Reposting this top-level because it was buried under a shitty comment: There is an answer to the question "Why is it so bad?" The answer is because the submission titles on this site suck. Very, very badly. They're generally non-descriptive and useless. People use submission titles as punchlines to a joke, not as an actual title. If a submission is titled "Look what I found", and it's a picture of a gold dubloon, what are you going to search for when you look for it 2 months later? "Gold coin", "gold dubloon", or something. You're not going to search for "Look what I found", because a) You won't have remembered that title, and b) That would turn up about a million results. Go to a subreddit that enforces submission titles (try the SFW-Porn network, they generally have very good titles), and try searching for something (restricted to that subreddit of course). I guarantee you'll get what you're looking for, if it exists. I've been saying this for a long time, but I'll say it again: Reddit should have a system which allow users to tag submissions with keywords, like "gold coin", "dubloon", and other descriptive words, which would then be weighted heavily in search results, based on how many times a post was tagged with a certain phrase or word. If 20 people tag a post with "gold coin", that will be weighted very heavily in the search results, and will probably be the #1 result when someone searches for "gold coin", even though the submission contained none of those words and just linked to an image hosted on imgur. The tags would be hidden from the public for the first hour or two (same as the vote count), so as not to encourage the same type of hivemind bias that exists with the voting system.
As a man that has reached the ripe old age of 48 I can promise you I have seen some shit go down. This one totally takes the cake for me though. I was waiting out front of a truck stop back in the mid 80's. Sitting on a park bench with a guy that had a big Rottweiler kinda dog on a leash with him. I tried to make small talk but he was quite a sourpuss. So we sat in silence for a few minutes until the most unexpected thing I have ever seen, happened right before my very eyes. While we were sitting there a big 18 wheeler pulls in without a trailer (bobtail) so he parks right up front like a normal car would. Inside the cab of the truck with the driver is a little monkey. The dance for the organ grinder kind. I think they are called Rhesus monkeys perhaps. Well the dog spots this lil monkey and proceeds to go apeshit over it. Lunging at the end of his leash and barking at the top of his lungs. Generally making a real spectacle of himself to say the least. The driver is obviously upset, but not nearly as much as the monkey is. Actually upset may be the wrong adjective to use for the monkey though. In retrospect I think eagerly aggressive may be a more appropriate description for his disposition. He was pacing the dashboard back and forth. Never taking his eyes off of this very aggravating dog. The driver opens his little triangle window that they don't make on cars anymore. The ones made for smokers back in the day. He yells out to this douche bag to call his dog off because it is upsetting his monkey. The guy laughs and says no way (I told you he was a jerk didn't I?). Says that his dog ain't bothering nobody. The dog hasn't shut up since he laid eyes on the monkey. I promise you he is bothering everybody for several blocks around. Now here's where things start to get interesting. The driver says that if he doesn't call his dog off he's gonna let his monkey loose on that dog. Douche bag laughs and says that his dog would eat that monkey alive. Upon hearing this the driver leans over and reaches into his glove box I guess. Pulls out one of those tiny baseball bats like you used to get at Astroworld or carnivals, and places it in the monkeys hand. The monkey obviously knows what's about to go down because he is now trying to squeeze out of that little triangular window I mentioned earlier. This monkey has murder in his eyes if I have ever seen it. Driver hollers "Last chance to save your dog's ass man." In response douche bag lets his dog off of the leash. Now we have a situation that has escalated to the point where we have a dog jumping up at the window and a monkey screaming profanities right back at him. Well, the driver finally rolls down the regular window and out leaps all kinds of miniature primate hell. The dog never knew what hit him. Quick as a flash this monkey is riding on the back of this dog's neck. His two back feet all wrapped up in his neck fur with one hand hanging onto an ear. The other hand as you may have guessed by now is steadily and mercilessly raining down blows about this dog's head and face. I mean hard blows. You can hear them whap whap whap. Well it only took a moment for the dog to realize he was in way over his head. He bolts yelping bloody murder as he runs away at full speed. I mean this dog is running so fuckin hard he's throwing up tufts of grass and dirt as soon as he leaves pavement. The monkey still riding him and beating on him the whole time. Douche bag acts like he wants to fight now but several people including myself stepped in to stop that nonsense. In a couple of minutes or so the little monkey comes loping back with his little bat still in hand, and leaps up into the still open window of the truck to await his master who has gone on into the store. That wanker ran off to try to go find his dog, but I don't know if he ever did. My ride showed up and I had to go. Never again in this lifetime will I see something so totally crazy and unexpected like that. I am both fortunate and humble to have been so privileged to be present for such an event. So Reddit, please do tell. What's your craziest thing you have ever seen in public? TL:DR Small monkey beats the shit out of large dog.Was having a new exhaust put onto my Subaru by a small specialty shop in Buffalo, NY. We dropped it off and then said we would just go walk around for a couple hours till it was done. Staff advised us not too as it was a rough area...we were 19, and from Canada, whats the worst that could happen? After walking through a couple blocks of burnt out hoses, and straight out of the movies (for us) ghetto w decided to turn around and get back to the shop ASAP! We walk around a corner only to see a group of 5 large, thugish looking young black men ahead of us, they notice us, turn and walk in our direction. Instant brick shitting...do we run...do we plead for our lives? We decide to do the Canadian thing and just keep walking like nothings going to happen. The "gang" reaches us after a few seconds, kind of does a half circle around the two of us, there is no escape, only robbery or death. What appears to be the leader makes contact "Yo, we got a question for you guys!". We sheepishly reply"uhhh yea?"
UPDATE: Wow... Just wow. 14 thousand comments and counting. I'm humbled and grateful for every one of the comments, upvotes and the endless amounts of music suggestions. Currently the most upvoted comment isn't a song suggestion but rather a suggestion to listen to the music from the beginnings of its orgins. Here's the original comment below as submitted by GiraffeKiller- "This is like introducing an Alien to the music of Earth. I wouldn't know where to start. Once you're through your kick on Classical, I might start with music from the 50's and progress through each decade. You can really see the growth of modern music like that." I think it's a wonderful idea, and will be blogging about my journey into the world of music. As many of you have pointed out; music didn't start in the 50's, so I'm going to start with the earliest written form of music… I'm going to start with Guillaume de Machaut's Agnus Dei. (Composed sometime between 1313 and 1365) I am still posting my top 5 next week... It will be a difficult task considering all the submissions. This week I am going to re-watch my favorite film of all time, Baraka. This will be my first time being able to hear the soundtrack of the film. I will be posting about that as well. Also for all of those asking- the hearing aids I got is the Phonak Naida S Premium. Again, thank you for all the kind words and shares! Even if you’re not hearing music for the first time ever, I suggest looking through the suggestions and expanding your musical tastes. You never know how much more days you have left to hear.... Trust me on this one, you don’t want to miss out on a great song. I've never understood it. My whole life I've seen hearing people make a fool of themselves singing their favorite song or gyrating on the dance floor. I've also seen hearing people moved to tears by a single song. That was the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around. I was born profoundly deaf and all music sounded like trash through my hearing aids. That is until a couple days ago when I put on a new pair of hearing aids for the first time in years. The first thing I heard was my shoe scraping across the carpet; it startled me. I have never heard that before and out of ignorance, I assumed it was too quiet for anyone to hear. I sat in the doctor's office frozen as a cacophony of sounds attacked me. The whir of the computer, the hum of the AC, the clacking of the keyboard, and when my best friend walked in I couldn't believe that he had a slight rasp to his voice. He joked that it was time to cut back on the cigarettes. That night, a group of close friends jump-started my musical education by playing Mozart, Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Sigur Ros, Radiohead, Elvis, and several other popular legends of music. Being able to hear the music for the first time ever was unreal. I realized that my old hearing aids were giving me a distorted version of music. they were not capable of distributing higher frequencies with clarity, instead it was just garbled gibberish. When Mozart's Lacrimosa came on, I was blown away by the beauty of it. At one point of the song, it sounded like angels singing and I suddenly realized that this was the first time I was able to appreciate music. Tears rolled down my face and I tried to hide it. But when I looked over I saw that there wasn't a dry eye in the car. I finally understood the power of music. Obviously, I did the only sensible thing and went on a binge of music. Below are my top 5 favorites from my limited exposure to the world of sound. Mozart's Lacrimsoa The soundtrack to Eleven Eleven… I can see how this comes off as narcissistic, it being my own film and all but it's such a personal work that when I listened to it for the first time I broke down. I felt like I was truly seeing the film for the first time ever. I'm grateful that Cazz was able to capture the tone perfectly. We discussed the film and specific scenes with essay-sized reasoning/deliberations on what should be conveyed. The critical response to the film surprised me and I still didn't quite get it until seeing the visual images coupled with the soundtrack. Sig Ros's Staralfur IL Postino-Luis Bacalov Minnesota's A Bad Place Ironically enough, I'm turning my hearing aids off more often than before because most sounds are even more annoying and the only times I have it on is when talking to people or listening to music/birds. Silence is still my favorite sound. When I turn my aids off my thoughts become more clear and it's absolutely peaceful. I hope that one day hearing people get the opportunity to experience utter silence. What exactly changed between my old hearing aids and my new ones? My previous hearing aids were only 4 years old but technology has gotten cheaper and better at an exponential rate since then. Before, I could almost hear the low frequencies at a hearing person’s level, but not as crisp... higher notes on the other hand, I didn’t hear at all. I never realized how little of a range my hearing aids picked up compared to hearing people until a telecommunications class in college. We were learning about radio equipment and the guest professor told us about how high human ears can hear and also compared to various animals. He turned around and turned the dial down to the lower pitches. I could still hear nearly all the low frequencies like rest of the class. When he turned the dial in the opposite direction, I blanked out at about 40% and the rest of the class stopped between 90-100%. It’s an odd feeling learning something so profound about yourself at twenty one... But it’s not as odd as the things I can hear now. It was during Lacrimosa that I realized I was truly hearing pitches I’ve never experienced before. It was like seeing a color I’ve never seen before. I honestly never thought I would really be able to hear my own soundtracks because I have accepted my deafness, I have always been and still am grateful for all I've been blessed with so it was never a big deal to me. Now... I'm overwhelmed and beyond grateful. But this is just the beginning. That’s why I’m asking you to give me the name of the most beautiful songs to you. I’ve posted the question on reddit and will listen to the top 30 upvotes and then post my top 5 from that batch. Original post over at http://www.artofthestory.com/being-able-to-hear-music-for-the-first-time-ever/Lucky you. I was told at 17 years and 11 months old by a hearing specialist that I would be deaf by the time I was 25. I listened to everything that I could find so I would have music to remember. I found the best way was to find people who love music and have good "ears." They will sort out the crap in their favorite genres just to amaze you with the excellent stuff. Doctor was wrong.I found the best way was to find people who love music and have good "ears." They will sort out the crap in their favorite genres just to amaze you with the excellent stuff. There must be a subreddit for this. How to find it...Having read that the doc was wrong, I hope to heck that you mean you can still hear...?

You know that awkward moment when you and a stranger are walking towards each other but need to get past each other and you get confused and end up doing a left to right dance? Not for me! When I walk through large crowds of people, to avoid walking into anyone, I simply stare at my destination. I look no one in the eyes. People actually will watch your eyes and they avoid the direction you are going. If I look into people's eyes as we are walking into each other, we are sure to collide. You have to let people know where you intend to go with your eyes. It always works for me, try it! Your turn, teach me some good mind tricks! *Edit- Wow I didn't know there were that many "mind tricks"! Thanks Redditors for your knowledge and wisdom! *Edit-Thank you masterthenight for the comment: "To add onto the OP comment, simply turning your head to indicate which direction you are going works as well." *Edit- One of the best responses I've heard comes from WhatAppearsToBeADuck: Tell any male adolescent that you think their voice is high. Their voice will immediately drop on their response. *Edit- another good comment from dmalfoy123: When you're driving, stare at the back of someone's head or their rear-view mirror and focus all your energy. They will eventually change lanes.Learned this one second hand from a smuggler: People tend to notice things they're looking for and once they don't find it (or even better, they do find it) they ignore everything else. So if you want to slip something by someone, make sure they catch you on something that doesn't matter, and they wont focus on what you're hiding. The story behind this is that in Berlin while the wall was up, there was this smuggler who used to ride, every day, from east Berlin into West Berlin (or perhaps it was vice versa, I don't remember) with a bag of sand on the back of his bicycle. Every time, the checkpoint guards would cut open the bag of sand, search through it, find nothing, and let him go on his way. And every night he would return. They never realized that he was smuggling bicycles.While an effective example of misdirection, that's an old joke.
EDIT: First on the front page. Nice. Jesus, more than 11500 comments. Thanks. EDIT: 15 on reddit.com, this means I'm famous. PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT IN AMERICA, USE MEDIAHINT.COM TO USE THE US NETFLIXThis Is England. The ending had me in tears.Man From Earth - "An impromptu goodbye party for Professor John Oldman becomes a mysterious interrogation after the retiring scholar reveals to his colleagues he never ages and has walked the earth for 14,000 years" The great thing about this film though is the setting. It's in one cabin, largely shot in one room with minimal editing. There's maybe 3-4 small scenes shot outside and in other rooms of the cabin, but it's shot and edited a la 12 Angry Men. The ending of the film blew me away too. Really well told story, and amazingly executed. 2. Timecrimes - "A man accidentally gets into a time machine and travels back in time nearly an hour. Finding himself will be the first of a series of disasters of unforeseeable consequences." It's a great portrayal that travel backwards in time if only by a couple dozen minutes can have catastrophic effects on somebody's life.
I'm Asian so all we did was study and go home and study some more. Hardly any sports so no dodge ball or other heinous sports. We only did things to advance our careers. I want to know, what's with the bullying and the cliques? Seriously, if you make so many movies on them, has to be slightly true right? Edit: Ok, so middle school is meaner. Guys, I'm not fully believing in the bible that's Hollywood movies. Just a point of reference. Because our English media growing up was American, I use that as a base. I don't believe everything movies is true. We don't have flying dragons or dance around trees. Lay off me, will ya? Edit 2: Internet hugs to all.For me, junior high (7th and 8th grade) was way worse socially than highschool. *edit: a wordI remember everyone played handball at my elementary school. Everyone. The cool kids used the dedicated handball walls, and everyone else picked a random wall and played with their friends. Until Pokemon cards existed towards the end of 6th grade, handball was what you did and if you didn't you were a freak. And then we went to middle school, and suddenly handball was for babies. People that brought their handballs for the first day of middle school were viciously attacked. Anyone who played handball at school was the lowest of the low and people who did it at home kept it a secret lest they be torn appart by prepubescent rage. I just want to make it clear though, it had only been 3 FUCKING MONTHS. There was no ramp down. Last day of 6th grade handball was still cool, first day of 7th grade 3 months later and it was suddenly pathetic. So yeah I agree, middle school was ruthless.
In what was posted on r/cyberlaws a few hours ago, it seems there is going to be a legal battle between Conde Nast and Warner Bross. I think the community has grown pass being a property of anyone, and I think a lot of us were unaware of this "User Agreement" between us the users and this company named Reddit. I love Reddit dearly with all my heart, it has brought a lot of happiness to a lot of users, some of that was thanks to the fact that people did not need to worry about copyrights, and I hate to see it crumble to become a patent/copyright troll on the back of its users. I'm not sure how it should be done legally, but I think that paragraph has no place in such place as Reddit, and I as a user will definitely change my behaviour on reddit as a result of finding out about it. Lost all control over the incoming messages and comments. I apologize if I'm not answering - feel free to send direct message on specific questions. alienth responded that they checking into this, and my comment with a couple of questions got downvoted and disappeared, so here are the questions I'm still hoping to get answers to: Can you give us more details? Can you in the meanwhile remove that pargraph? When is it going to be actually changed? Are we going to be allowed to comment on the new user agreement before it is imposed on the community?I believe one of the reasons for that is that we couldn't technically host your comments as you could sue reddit for infringement if some type of usage agreement wasn't in place. I am not a lawyer, but I'll ping the lawyers to check. We're actually in the process of revamping the user-agreement, as it contains several clauses which aren't really relevant to us. cheers, alienthi think what we all really want to know is whether or not reddit is going to cockblock the movieOn slashdot all the comments are owned by the submitter (yes, even the anonymous ones).

Edit: What a response! Thanks for all the comments. The question came about because I've been having songs from Les Miserables stuck in my head the last week, not sure why. I haven't seen the musical or the new movie, only the 10th Anniversary stage version, and I haven't even seen that one in like four years. So whatever. But the lines that have been really getting me are: But there are dreams that cannot be And there are storms we cannot weather I had a dream my life would be So different from this hell I'm living So different now from what it seemed Now life has killed the dream I dream And it just got me thinking about how much I love songs that make me sad. Sally Sparrow said this once about being sad: "It's happy for deep people." So now I have a ton of sad songs to look up. Thanks everyone!'In the middle of the night I was sleeping sitting up, when a doctor came to tell me, "Enough is enough." He brought me out into the hall (I could have sworn it was haunted), and told me something that I didn't know that I wanted to hear: That there was nothing that I could do to save you, the choir's gonna sing, and this thing is gonna kill you.' Two by The Antlers. The whole album is about a hospice worker who falls in love with a terminally ill patient, as a big metaphor for the singer's relationship with his abusive ex-girlfriend. Kills me every time I listen to it.UGH I LOVE THE ANTLERS BUT CAN'T LISTEN TO THE WHOLE OF HOSPICE WITHOUT SOBBING...'epilogue' gets me every time.Totally agree about the album Hospice. My vote for saddest lyrics come at the end of "Wake" though: Don't be scared to speak Don't speak with someone's tooth Don't bargain when you're weak Don't take that sharp abuse Some patients can't be saved But that burden's not on you
Mine is when I went to the Oatmeal homepage and right clicked and did view page source. (OK SO JUST SAYING MY FRIEND TOLD ME TO DO THIS I TECHNICALLY DIDN'T FIND IT BUT I REALIZED THERE WAS A COMIC) [This came up.] (http://imgur.com/i2CvS) Then I saw that in the words by the PTERODACTYL's mouth it said HTTP://PTERODACTYL.ME so I went there and well [this] (http://theoatmeal.com/comics/ptero) is what it brought me to. I was impressed. [EDIT] OK so i wasnt sure if the http address would work so I added the other one they are the same. Just chill about it. [EDIT] WOW!! I never expected this to become soooo big thank you all! Even getting close to the front page is amazing! Again THANK YOU ALL!! [EDIT] Again how did this get so much upvotes. I am surprised. It is the end of my first month of Reddit and I like to think I am doing pretty well..... [EDIT] Nobody is here anymore but someone just commented about a couple days ago. I thought this was archived. I love cats. Cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat. rape. Dead people. Pigeon. I hope someone sees this. And my penis. I have a girlfriend. Gay faggot shit chips. I'm not crazy..I found an internal message board for a small local bank. The (clearly incompetent) IT dept had made it publicly accessible and I stumbled upon it via Google (so, no robots.txt either). There were lots of documents posted on those boards... internal communications, financial statements, board meeting notes, etc... After having a look around for a few minutes I decided it would be best to just report it and forget about it. I emailed the domain contact and a handful of board members from the contacts page and (somewhat to my relief) got a response back the next day thanking me for the heads up. I checked to make sure they had taken it down and it wasn't accessible anymore. I know that's anticlimactic... but I thought it was... interesting. It certainly made me think twice about where I keep my money. EDIT: Pics and it did happen: http://i.imgur.com/riCHn.png phew almost ran out of black ink there...Love those kind of things. I've once found out that by changing the session cookie I can access all the history + personal data of a big chain video rental here. Let them know, sent ways to fix it. All went great.
A few weeks ago I was horny and for god knows what reason, decided to try use my cellphone as a vibrator. Anyway... it got stuck up there and the only person who could get me to hospital was my friend (Who thought it was hilarious). On the way there he posted on Facebook informing the world of my situation, along with my cellphone number. For the next hour, I sat in the emergency room waiting area receiving uncomfortable stares as the phone in my ass rung and vibrated, All the while my flatmate laughing hysterically and telling me I'd better answer it as it could be important. If anyone can top this you have my upvote. EDIT: I am male :( EDIT2: This story is fake, and It's hilarious you all believe it when I didn't provide a shred of evidence.My story: When I was 13 a doctor wrote me an adult dose for a certain medicine based on my weight. I was a fat kid. Our body does not work that way and the medicine ended up constipating me...for a month. I did not shit for a whole month. I got sick. I had racoon-like eyes, my stomach would jump or flutter by itself, I had cramps, etc. It was bad. I was miserable. I finally told my parents how long it had been since i had shit and they freaked out and took me to the hospital. There, they gave 3 enemas back to back. After the third and final one, all that water softened all that shit up just enough i could expel it. I ran to the nearest bathroom, gown open in the back, and tried to make it to the toilet. I didn't My ass was hovering at a 45 degree angle above the toilet when the geyser burst. This next part is not a lie, but i know some of you will think it is, I got shit everywhere. On the ceiling (somehow), on the floor, the toilet was covered, the walls, even the sink got hit with some spray. Shit was literally, yes literally, sprayed on all walls and ceiling. It was everywhere. I felt like a new kid after that. Cleaned myself up the best i could and then had to figure out what to do. There was no way i could clean it all up, I needed a janitor. So I walked out and politely told a nurse the bathroom need a clean up and badly.
Link to original So, amazingly, crustlessmist and jwild98 determined the correct license and created a damning visual aid to show it within hours of my original submission. I gave the information to the police, who took over a week to respond to me, but said that they located the owner of that license and served papers to them. Meanwhile, I had given the same information to my insurance provider: Geico. They ended up telling me that the other party was also insured with Geico and had submitted a claim just after the accident happened, claiming that they were involved in a hit and run(!). I asked and the agent told me that they claimed the car was parked and unoccupied when it was hit. The other agent got a recorded statement from me over the phone, which was extremely formal. She was all business until she asked if she could stop recording and I said yes, after which she said, "Woooooow. I haven't had one like this in a long time!" After some talking and investigation by Geico, they determined that I was the innocent party and I finally got a car rental from them (after a month of sharing a van with my wife and three kids, which is a pain when you need to get to work early). They didn't want to give me the rental earlier because they didn't know whether MY uninsured motorist insurance should pay for it or if we would find the other party and make their insurance pay for it. Geico found out that the insured person's son had been driving that night and decided to lie about the accident when they got home. I still figure he must have been doing something illegal at the time since he had insurance and still didn't stop. I don't know, though. The police never told me his name and haven't contact me further regarding the issue. Yesterday, they finally inspected and estimated the repairs my car would need. Today, they told me that they were declaring it a total loss and they will give me $2,800 (and change) for my 2000 Buick LeSabre Ltd. I'm not a car guy, but I remember him saying something along the lines of the "rails" being warped and the quarterpanels being bowed out and some other things. They were just looking at body damage and it was over the value of the car (it's not counting the mechanical damage that was done). I have until Friday to determine if I want to accept the offer for the title. Geico also said they would pay for my medical bills, but it's a one time payment after treatment is ended. I have to give them HIPAA permission to get my bills from my medical providers and they will pay them. They also mentioned something about "mental anguish" and "suffering" but never mentioned a number. I guess a month without my normal convenient mode of travel and initially not being able to walk without immense pain after the accident count as anguish and suffering... so how much is that worth? I can't really think of an amount that I'd be happy to take if it were going to happen to me again. So one day I'm sitting at a red light, minding my own business and a month and a half later I've lost my primary vehicle for an amount of money that can't cover a comparable vehicle. Still, it was exciting to hunt down the offender and at least get him to be held accountable for his prevarications and douchebaggery. Thank you for all of the help, reddit! Edit: saw the wall of text after I submitted and determined I should add a tl;dr TL;DR: Cops found ass who hit me and ran. Geico also found him. Ass had claimed hit-and-run on his own vehicle. Geico determined I was right and he was wrong. Geico says it will pay for my medical bills. Geico totals my car and offers me $2,800 (I have until Friday to accept). I now have no car. Edit: It is amazingly difficult to keep up with the waves of people crashing into this thread. I just want people to know that I'm doing my best to read the comments, even if I'm not responding to all of them. And I'm totally getting the feeling that I need to speak to a lawyer. :) Thank you. Edit: Wow! The number 1 spot on the front page! And I didn't even misspell anything in the title or make any glaring grammatical errors! To think I was just sitting here tonight browsing reddit and kind of half-assedly thought, "I guess after today I have enough to give them a decent update... yeah, ok, I'll write it out." I should have taken a picture of my empty driveway and posted it and then I could have reaped all of this sweet karma. Edit: I just looked up the guy's name in the court website and found out that he's got a hearing coming up on the 14th. He was charged with "Failure to Stop / Accident - MISD" and the code section is here. It says that it should be a Class 5 Felony. This page says that a class 5 felony is punishable by a jail term of 1 to 10 years, or up to a year in jail and/or up to $2,500 in fines. The court website lists that as the code section, but it also lists the type of case as a Class 1 Misdemeanor. I should call and tell them my car just got totaled.Protip: Never take the insurance company's first offer. Ask for more.This seems to be the consensus.Ask for more. Then whatever you settle on, ask them for $200 less and to keep the car. (They just junk 'em anyway.)How much more should you ask for and how many times should you ask?while i acknowledge the truth of this in life in general, it makes me sad because it seems like it rewards the squeaky obnoxious wheels...that and...i'm never that guy... sigh... well, maybe one day i'll be part of the mythical class action where we inherit the earth..after it's a consumed cinder :)
Pictures encouraged **Edit:**Wow this blew up! There are some awesome ideas from here that I have written down. Also, reddit really likes pens. I'll do my best to go over each comment. Thanks reddit, you guys rock...again. Edit 2: Apparently, there are some amazing people on reddit. Please check out r/santashelpers and see their good work. Thank you Elon_Musk for helping to provide such a positive subreddit. And I shit you not, I'm trying my best to keep up guys.My go to Secret Santa gift is an 18" blowdart gun and a pack of 50 practice darts from amazon. $20, free shipping, and it easily fits in a desk drawer to take the office battle to the next level. EDIT: I posted a link lower but here it is again. http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?ie=UTF8&marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&me=A2RF2KLPIUS45GMy wife is presently angry with you, because this is now on its way to my house. Thank you.If you're shooting them in the office, a length of 1/2 inch PVC pipe and some nerf darts works great also. There's tips on Instructables for spiffing one up- mine has dollar store plastic rope for grip and a neck loop, some duct tape, and an extending little auto-inspection mirror for "tactical purposes."
Shortly after my mom died, I was drunk as hell at a bar in my hometown (which was a frequent occurrence in those days). I was having a rough night, so I went outside to sit on the curb and have a cigarette. This older gentleman, probably around 60-65 sat down next to me because he said I reminded him of his daughter and he wanted to help me feel better if he could. I talked to this guy for a good hour, about my mom, about my life, about dropping out of college and basically losing control of everything because I couldn't deal with her passing. He gave me some of the best advice I've ever received and made me feel like things could really be okay again, eventually. He waited there with me until the bar closed and my friends found me. I gave him a huge hug and tried to thank him as genuinely as I could. I never saw him again and I have no way of finding him, but I think about him all the time and how much of an impact a total stranger had on my life. Edit: the advice he gave me is further down this thread, sorry!Well... What was the advice?
I've since unblocked reddit (obviously) Update: She's gone home now presumably to check reddit. We ended it on these words: Me: "It's a shame the internet isn't working, there was a really good article on employer-employee relationships that I wanted to show you, you probably won't be interested though. I'm sure you've... Reddit Her: "If I catch you messing around on the internet again, I'll give you a formal warning and tell all your internet friends about the time you called me 'babe', ok?" Well the jokes on you babe because it's already out... shitWell. Top story on reddit. You've now revealed your username to your boss. Time to start deleting posts.MrPafanopolous: User for 3 months Yep, I don't think he thought this through completely.Unblock Reddit.com and block imgur.com just to mess with them some more.This is what they do to me at work and it's fucking infuriating.That's not funny, my work did that. First they blocked Imgur. Then they blocked reddit. Now neither are blocked. I think they're screwing with me.
Edit: Wow! I wasn't expecting so many awesome ideas. Keep them coming! In a couple hours we'll be going shopping to pick up everything we need for a day of science. Edit 2: You guys are amazing. I'm still reading through all the suggestions, but these are the ones we'll definitely be doing: Corn starch & water Volcano Mentos + Diet Coke, followed by soda bottle vortex Pepper in a bowl of water Moebius strip Penny and nickel battery Egg in a bottle Soap, milk and food coloring Crushed soda can Film canister rocket Liquid with layered colors Cork rocket Frozen bubbles Supercooled water Clouds in a bottle Update: I smell like vinegar and have food coloring all over my hands, but we had a ton of fun. We didn't quite get to everything this afternoon, but now we have supplies for another time. All told, we had to buy about $20 worth of stuff at the grocery store -- there's no way you'll have this much fun with less money! And he learned a lot, too (especially about pressure, which was probably just because it's easiest for me to explain). Thanks so much for everyone who contributed ideas. I'll be visiting this post over and over again to find other fun ideas for future lazy Saturdays:)Mix corn starch and water to create a non-Newtonian fluid. When left alone it will act like a liquid but when acted upon by a force it will react like a solid. If you hold it in your hand it will run through your fingers but if you punch the fluid it will hardenDon't forget the food coloring! When I was a preschool teacher we called it Ooblek.Sold. That one's definitely going on the list.^ this, if you have an old shitty speaker you dont want put it in there and play dubstep. mind: blown
While working at HHGregg, customers were told we'd recycle their old TV's for them. Really we just threw them in the dumpster. Can't speak for HHGregg corporation as a whole, but at my store this was the definitely the case. McAllister's Famous Iced Tea is really just Lipton with a shit ton of sugar. They even have a trademark for the "Famous Iced Tea." There website says, "We can't give you the recipe, that's our secret." The secrets out, Lipton + Sugar = Trademarked Famous Iced Tea. McAllister's About Page Edit: Thanks for all the comments and upvotes. Really interesting read, and I've learned many things/places to never eat.The recycle bins at Seaworld also just get emptied into the dumpster. They are just there to make the visitors feel better.I'm really starting to wonder how often designated recycling actually gets recycled.I used to work at Claires and The Icing (same company). We got about 15 minutes of training before we were allowed to pierce kids' ears. If people bled on the ear piercing guns, we would simply wipe them off with a tissue, and use them again on the next person. We were also never taught anything about cross-contamination and blood borne pathogens during training. I would never take my kids to get their ears pierced at the mall. Choose a reputable body piercer and take your kids there. Some people are afraid of taking their kids to body piercers because they look sketchier than the pretty mall down the street, but body piercers will use an autoclave and most of them (if they're any good) are trained to properly deal with blood and bodily fluids. The person at the mall, no matter how much experience they say they have, does not have the proper tools to deal with blood. About 99% of our piercings did not draw blood, but the 1% that do are definitely not dealt with well. I tried my best when I worked there, but there's only so much you can do when there is no equipment on hand to properly sterilize anything.
Edit: the hivemind has spoken. Edit 2: This thread has apparently caught a second wind as of 10/27...I'm getting 50 Tom Cruise's per day in my mailbox again. Do you have any suggestions on how to harness the power of the hivemind to make something happen? PM me with your ideas! Edit 3: Listen guys, this post itself will get archived in a couple months' time, but that doesn't mean we can't keep it alive by starting a never-ending comment chain (thanks for the suggestion, OakTable). So let's keep this an immortal thread for posterity's sake and comment below me! Edit 4: "Belgium prosecutes Scientology as a criminal organisation.

I remember the confusion and directionless futility of the job hunt after graduating from college. I ended up in a career I didn't know existed, and has little to do with my major. It should be helpful to current college graduates to know what is out there. What is your job? EDIT: Lots of interesting jobs. Might be helpful to readers if you post your actual Title and experience/degrees you have in order to land the job (if you want).I start on Friday as a Standardized Patient. Essentially, med students practice their bedside manner on me.They practice a lot more than bedside manner on some standardized patients. We have one guy locally who is the go-to for DREs. He gets paid to have a class of med students locate his prostate.I cut eyes out of dead people. I am an eye bank technician; I surgically remove corneas and whole eyes from donors for cornea transplants and research. I think most people don't WANT to know about my job.Well, when I die, I'll be seeing you.... or notMy brother has had two cornea transplants (due to keratoconus). Eventually he would have gone blind without the transplants. Its been about 12 years since the transplants, and his vision is getting worse again, so he will eventually need another transplant. Its rough. Anyway, THANK YOU for your work. :)
Just trying to gauge interest for a website concept EDIT: Okay, looks like I'm gonna go for it. Anyone with any sort of website building experience is welcome to give me advice :) EDIT 2: poorstudentscookbook.com is up and running! I'm gonna be working hard throughout the night to figure out how to actually run a website. Recipes and shit will be posted shortly. Thanks for all the interest! EDIT 3: First Recipe is up! Let me know what you guys think! I will accept all criticism. EDIT 4: Yes, I know the website is ugly right now. I promise to make it pretty in the near future, as soon as I start figuring out website development haha EDIT 5: The website is going to be free. I don't know why people think I'm making you pay for the recipes. I'll have ads but that's about it. And there will be a vegetarian section. It's not all going to come together instantly, but I can assure you that by the time school starts (September 1st for me) I will have a fully-functioning website. EDIT 6: A lot of you are messaging me with ideas for my website, and I just want you all to know that while I may not be able to reply to everyone, I'm going to try my best to take any and all suggestions into account. The response I've gotten has been awesome. I promise not to disappoint my fellow redditors!yes! r/richmealpoorstudentthank you for naming my websitehttp://budgetbytes.blogspot.com/I created r/budgetfood less than two months ago for this.It would be nice if some of the recipes were healthy meals, also. I have no troubles cooking cheap, it's cheap healthy food I struggle with. :/healthy in what sense? I have absolutely no problem eating foods that don't have tons of fat and grease. But I do struggle with fresh produce. I think that's pretty much unavoidable; produce tends to be expensive for what it is. And even when it isn't expensive, it goes bad over time so some of it goes to waste. There's nothing you can really do about that though. :( Frozen produce is the only way to avoid the relentless cycle.
Sex offenders get their address, picture, etc. posted online and restrictions about where they can live and where they can go, but in the mean time you could be living next to a murderer and be none the wiser. Why is that fair?Illinois requires murderers to register.I'm trying to debate internally how this would go out. "Hi, I'm a registered murderer. I'm required to let everyone within a 5-mile radius that I strangled my family in a fit of rage last October."I was confused, then I realized this happened after I escaped.I had it explained this way by the person in charge of my state's sex offender profiling: Unless you're a serial killer, murder is not driven by a compulsion. Murder is something people do either for gain or because they're angry. It's usually either targeted or it's a spur of the moment thing. If you live two doors down from someone who has committed murder but isn't a serial killer, and you don't fuck with them, there's probably a very good chance they won't murder you.
Throwaway accounts might be prudent. EDIT: TIL that every single corporation on the planet is unscrupulous, filthy, shady, nauseating, and/or just plain evil, and that I should never, ever shop anywhere ever again. EDIT #2: At this point I could not care less if my friend is full of shit or not, because these replies are AWESOME!Former fast food manager here. I don't know if this is a company-wide thing, but our regional McManager "strongly discouraged" us from firing anyone who had worked there more than six months, since they'd be eligible for unemployment. Instead, we were encouraged to make their lives into a living hell until they (hopefully) gave up and quit.it's practically policy at McDonald's. source: My McDonald's Manager Handbook.At Walmart the code for the intercom is #961. You are welcome and have fun. Edit 1: Ok just to clear up a few things. #961 is default intercom number. I have worked at 5 different Walmarts and at each this code could be used. One store had a different number (like #445) but #961 would still work. Every Walmart used to use the same code (#960) until someone decided to shout racist things over it lol. Then they changed the default by one number making it #961. Trust me....it works lol
I'm talking weird occurrences, coincidences you haven't been able to easily explain. I'll start. We have a breakfast laid on at work every morning, just a simple buffet of eggs, bacon what have you. Nothing huge and it's really only to feed about a dozen people or so. I am usually one of the first guys from my team to get to work and the kitchen was deserted as usual. I walked into the little kitchen, there was a ceramic egg tray thing with 12 eggs in it, like the bottom half of an egg carton with a socket for each egg. All spaces are filled with warm freshly boiled eggs. I take one, walk over to the garbage bin, shuck the shell then I walk back over to the food and stop dead. There are 12 eggs in the tray again. No one entered the room while I was peeling the thing. I touched the mystery egg it was the same temp as the other eggs around it. Not a big thing, nothing major, but something very strange. Given one does not get presented with strange eggs from a parallel universe every day I peeled and ate that one too. TL:DR - Found strange quantum egg at breakfast. Ate it. Did not gain super powers. EDIT Holy crap. You magnificent bastards, we're on the front page! Your stories are wonderful, uplifting and truly freaky in equal measure. But it's nice to know other people notice shit like this too. Redditor Wanhope was kind enough to start a subreddit for this topic so feel free to drop in and share your experiences!This will probably get buried .. When I was around 20, a few years ago, I kept having dreams about a woman with long black hair named Aroura [ pronounced A-roar-uh) . They were different dreams but for some reason, her distinct face and name always ended up in them. It got to the point where I would wake up frustrated and confused, trying to google her name or find out how I was connected to her. After a few months she stopped showing up and I dismissed it, thinking my brain was just being a "scumbag." Fast forward a few years later, Halloween 2009, I'm in the car with a friend stopped at a gas station. I'm about to pull out and merge onto a highway when I get a phone call from a random number, so I stop the car but no one answered. There was a person behind me who grew impatient, honked at me, and then swerved in front of me instead of waiting for 2 seconds for me to move. Second they get on the highway, some silver civic loses control of their wheel and crashes into the car that swerved in front of me. I called the cops and waited at the gas station for them to come. Turns out the drivers of both cars died. It 100% would of been me if I hadn't of got that phone call. Called it back a few hours later out of gratitude and curiosity, rang 3 times and went to voicemail. "Hi, you've reached aurora, please leave your name and number." Never had goosebumps like that in me life.

Whenever you have a voice automated phone system, typically saying "representative" gets you someone right away. Update In regards to Cheat Code # 2 I recommend this site: http://gethuman.com/ keep a spare car key in your wallet/purse. If you have a bulky Key that won't fit in your wallet, get a key made that doesn't have the electronic chip on it. It will still unlock the car, it just won't start it. changed by popular request Risk Update: if your wallet is stolen they have your car key. All they need to do is go to your house some time later and take your car out of your driveway. Riding a bicycle will save you lots of money on gas, parking, medical bills, and gym memberships. If you are speeding and suddenly up ahead see a cop that clearly just tagged you, slow down and wave to him/her. Your odds of being pulled over are quite a bit reduced. Don't be rude, but NEVER answer any cops questions when they call you in for questioning. when getting lectured into voice mail, hit 1, pause momentarily. If you aren't put through immediately, hit *, pause. Finally, hit # if neither 1 or * worked. It is called the 1-star-pound technique, and it works for all cell carriers. If your credit card magnetic stripe starts to get worn from use and being in your wallet, and doesn't always read in the card reader, you can use the plastic bag trick. Put the card in a plastic grocery bag and then swipe it. Not sure why it works, but it does.Taking it further though, you can simply apply a piece of quality cellophane tape over the mag stripe for a "permanent" plastic bag trick. At the end of your shower turn the water really (or all the way) cold. This will wake you up and get blood flowing. Update update 9: It also closes your pores to allow for less dirt and bacteria to get in to help reduce acne problems. Macy's credit cards usually have a 20% discount on purchases. I pay with the Macy's card, then while still at the register, I immediately pay off the charge with my debit card.

Unless its food, then buy it in season. When you have forgotten someones name, simply say : "I'm sorry, but what was your name one more time." They may act offended, but when they give you there first name you simply reply "No, I meant your last name." (more socially acceptable to forget). Bingo. First and last names. When eating buffalo wings, the flat portions. You can detach the smaller bone on one end very easily, then twist it a bit and it will just slide out.

Most tinfoil and saran wrap boxes have little push-in tabs on the sides. If you push them in, the roll won't fall out when you try to rip out a sheet of it. Keep a list of all of the credit card phone numbers (1-800) in your cell phone. This way, if your wallet is ever lost, you can call them immediately to have them disabled. It's also a good idea to place all of the cards in your wallet on a copier and print a page to keep at home. This will give you access to your License #, etc. Update: You should update 20. If you lose your wallet.. as in misplace it.. put a hold on your credit cards. Do NOT cancel. If you cancel it can later show up on your credit report. If you believe you are going to find it later, placing a hold saves you the red mark on your report. If you are driving an unfamiliar car and you don't know which side the gas tank is on, just look at the little pump icon next to the gas gauge on the dashboard. The pump handle on the icon will be on the side of the tank. Update: saw the gas tank one on an older reddit, turns out the handle thing is not consistant. But there IS usually a little arrow next to the icon. Second Update 99% of the time the gas door is opposite of the tailpipe. So far, I have only found that early-mid 2000 Pontiac Vibes break this trend. Third update if there is no arrow, then it most likely is on the passenger's side. I've yet to see one without an arrow that wasn't on the passenger's side this tip was unpopular, so im changing it This one changed my life. If you're at home/work/party or GOD forbid your girlfriend's house and the toilet starts to overflow, take the lid off the back reservoir part and lift the long handle as far up as it will go.

The fine for this offense (at the university I worked at) was $250, and usually a ban from parking at the university (i.e., booted or towed on sight). College Parking Cheat Code: Anyone who's gone to a college or university knows they usually charge a ridiculous amount of money for parking (usually $300+ for a semester pass or $10+ for the daily passes), a service that should fucking be free for students considering the high cost of education. Fuck them. Buy one daily pass at the beginning of the school year (usually a small paper ticket printed out a machine on the lot), take it home and scan it, photoshop the date for tomorrow, and print. Repeat for the next 4 years. Anyone with even the most rudimentary photoshop skills can pull this off convincingly.

Speaking for the US. I don't know about other countries. EDIT: I'm not personally concerned for my safety or my neighborhood. The question just came to me this morning and I wanted to hear some arguments from both sides!I know in Indiana all violent offenders are registered. Child molestation and related crimes, rape, murder, attempted murder, and I've even seen battery on registry entries with no sexual crime listed.I live in Indiana and am bored at work. Is there a website where I can look this up?Also, many states have "Whiskey Plates" -- license plates that indicate a prior DWIBasically, because some girl got raped and killed by a next door neighbor who had previously pleaded guilty to two prior sexual assaults on young girls. After this happened, everyone was floored that no one had been informed this guy had a prior record, as presumably they would have acted differently had they known. This outrage eventually became Megan's Law, which was then taken on in other states across the country.
throwaways welcome. Edit: front page?!?! looks like my inbox icon will be staying orange...ALPR cameras. Most people are probably aware that a lot of police cars have automatic plate-reading cameras, but they don't realize just how much information they collect. Every single license plate that is seen by the cameras, whether the car is moving or not, is stored in a database with its time and GPS coordinates. Then you can look up every instance of when a particular plate was seen by any ALPR camera in the system, on a Google Maps type interface with a moveable time window. Over time you can build up a really comprehensive view of an individual's movements.God dammit it's hard to be a criminal nowadays.ALPR gave me a really shitty weekend once. We used to get notices in the mail that our vehicles would expire their registration soon. Apparently the state stopped doing that and a state trooper stopped me using ALPR to detect that had an expired registration. Then he forced me to give up the car to have it towed and impounded. This was on a Friday. The impound lot closes a hour from the time I was pulled over. On top of that, it was the Friday before the weekend when hurricane sandy was coming. I drive a 93 corvette and it doesn't handle heavy rain well due to poor weatherstripping.

5 min ago my reddit all turned spanish....all the tabs, preferences..etc. I went into preferences and made sure they were checked to english....they were....what is going on? I cant read spanish so I am in need of some help here....i am asking you b/c I cannot find the mod help link b/c I cannot read it. UPDATE- ok- it must have something to do with firefox. And to all of you telling me how to change lang. preference, OF COURSE I TRIED THAT before I posted. On IE all is normal. On my desktop all is normal. On my netbook, using firefox, it is a taco show. I ran the page through google translator and I especially enjoy the rick roll. So anyone know how to un-spanish reddit in firefox? This is the only page it is happening on. EDIT- I must admit this is hilarious. I wish i had paid more attention in spanish class.... UPDATE- So I wake up this morning to about 1500 replies in my inbox that I cannot read. And then I run them through Google translator and most of them say stuff like "the dog is in my pants" and "where is the library". Thanks, reddit. As far as the Spanish problem goes.. I disabled all my firefox extensions, cleared all my cookies and restarted it all again. THE SPANISH IS GONE!

So I was in a coffee shop this morning studying for a midterm. At one point I look up from my table and I see a twenty dollar bill laying at the feet of an attractive blonde making an order. I assumed it was hers since her wallet was open, so I walked over, picked it up and gave it to her. She took a look in her wallet and had all her money accounted for, so she told me it wasn't hers and said something along the lines of 'finders keepers'. So without thinking I handed the twenty to the cashier to pay for her order and walked back to my table. A few moments later, the blonde walked over to thank me and give me the change. I said "I know that normally guys are supposed to introduce themselves first and then take a girl out for coffee, but since I did this all backwards, how would you like to sit down and give me a chance to introduce myself?" She sat down. We talked. I got her phone number AND a date this weekend. In no way could I have scripted it any better. So Reddit, what is the smoothest thing you or someone else has done or said that ended in a date? EDIT: I scored a date AND the front page! Today was a good day!I worked at an "information desk" on a college campus about two years ago. One day, an attractive young lady around my age asked me where the cookie shop was. I directed her to it, and she thanked me. After she left, I realized I should have made a move, and I hated myself for not doing so. Then, I saw her later that day. I waved to her. She waved back and smiled. I motioned for her to come to the desk. I asked her, plain and simple, "Could I call you some time?" She said sure and gave me her phone number. One day while we were chatting about a week later, I asked her what kind of cookie she went to get the first time I saw her. She had no idea what I was talking about. Because she wasn't the same girl I had seen initially.
ALRIGHT ALRIGHT WE'LL DO IN AMA NEXT MONDAY STARTING AT 10AM PST Thank you everyone for the awesome response. Our traffic just shot up 350% and it's still going up. Sorry about not responding enough, we got entirely overwhelmed by the comments and discussion. There were many serious questions and we think we can try to answer them better in r/IAmA. See you then! I'm one of the founders of Microryza, we're basically like, crushing it. I'm just kidding. Science crowdfunding is hard. But we love what we're doing so much that we dropped out of grad school to spend the past year doing nothing but coding and talking to scientists. We think it's important because when were working in labs, all these brilliant scientists and professors never spent their time in their lab doing research and spent all their time writing grant proposals. We decided that science isn't supposed to work like this. A recent survey by NIH saw that the average PI spends 12 weeks/year writing grant proposals. I wrote a blog post about this and some of the other problems that young scientists face in academia:
I'm guessing they accidently went with the default "ship to billing address" option. The kicker is they actually called me (pretending to be a Best Buy employee), said they had shipped a package in error and I should leave it outside for UPS to pickup. Luckily, I noticed the charge on my credit card and was able to return the iPad for a full refund. I gave the phone number to the cops. EDIT: Holy crap front page, damn it typo!A friend of mine had his backpack with his $1400 engineering laptop in it, stolen, while at the campus food court. I had a weird gut feeling it would turn up on Craigslist, or somewhere similar. Everyday for a week I checked Craigslist. Exactly one week later, I found the laptop. This EXTREMELY stupid criminal took a picture of the laptop screen WITH MY FRIEND'S LOGIN NAME. Yeah, very stupid criminal. So I contacted the seller immediately via email and he responded within 20 minutes. I said I'd like to buy the laptop from him. We agreed to meet at a near by parking lot later that day. Next, we called the cops. They agreed to set up a sting on the theif. One of the officers pretended to be a buyer, and approached the thief. The officer acted as if he was examining the laptop, but was actually looking for the serial number. BOOM, it had a matching serial number and they arrested this dumbshit. A week ago (Four months later) the guy was proven guilty, and to my knowledge, is spending a year in prison. Plus, my buddy finally got his laptop back!
If most people didn't have to go to work, wouldn't voter turn-out be higher?I'm sorry, but we have Columbus Day off here at work (as well as, President's Day). I can't logically or rightfully fathom why Election Day isn't a holiday when something as absurd as Columbus day is. /end rant.It's because Election Day is designated by the Constitution and predates Columbus Day. In 1787 when the document was drafted, the concept of "holiday" usually just referred to religious celebrations, so making it a holiday back then wouldn't have made much sense at the time. Then the question is: why haven't we changed this? Answer: we haven't changed this in the current day because the federal government makes changes at a snail's pace, and frankly changing the dynamics of election day just isn't an issue that they're ever going to care about.Here's something to consider. Would a national holiday make voting harder for some people? Keep in mind that national holidays are only suggestions as far as work is concerned (outside of the federal government), but schools usually do abide by them. How many people would need to stay home and take care of their kids all of a sudden? Sounds like what you want is a mandated national holiday. That's something new and different.
When I worked at Hollywood video (before that evil corporation went out of business) a man came into my store and bought one bag of popcorn. When I opened the register he pulled a box cutter out of his pocket and told me to give him all the money. My first reaction was to laugh. I couldn't believe I was being robbed. He then waved the box cutter around and swore he wasn't horsing around to which I told him he wasn't getting anything. He said he'd cut me and I told him good luck climbing over the counter to get me. He then placed his hands on the counter and leaned towards me. I grabbed a box cutter of my own and said look at that, a Mexican stand off. Now here is where it gets silly. The man asked if I was threatening him. I said no sir, still laughing at the situation. He then proclaimed he was calling the police and I said please do. He did and he WAITED for the police to arrive! He told them I brandished a box cutter and threatened his life. I then showed the fine officer our security footage and wouldn't you know it? He arrested my new friend. That's my favorite work story, call it bullshit if you want. So, any great stupid "criminal" stories?I worked at a bowling alley in high school. We had a guy climb up into the ceiling in the restroom and wait until we closed, so he could climb down and rob it. Not only did he not get any money (everything was locked up in a gigantic safe from the 1930's that probably weighed over a thousand pounds), but he couldn't even get out of the building - all the steel fire doors were padlocked on the outside, and I guess he didn't want to risk being seen smashing the glass on the front doors, since it was right by a busy road. He did the only logical thing, which was go back to the bar and drink all night - the manager found him passed out on the floor when he opened up in the morning.this is strangely similar to a story I wasn't going to post, because it was very successful. also at a bowling alley where I used to work, guy hides in the ceiling of the bathroom (we think - still hasn't been caught) comes down after we close, deactivates alarm (smashes it) breaks down a fire exit, lets in his buddies ( we presume, based on what happens next) and then they leave with the entire safe - which was also very old like the one in your story and weighed at least 1/4 tonne - and ALL the CCTV footage. unfortunately there was only about £30 in the safe.

She was telling me about it today and i couldn't think about anything except how horrible high school people can be. So here's the story. This guy set up a facebook event for this party at this big hall and over 120 people RSVP'd. 700+ invited. So it's not like no one knew about it. Considering the amount of people that would know about it and come, even if they hadn't clicked attending, was that high this guy booked a massive hall that could cater for such a large event. This cost him around $1500 which included food, security etc. Then he decided instead of using an iPod, which would probably get lost/stolen on the night, he'd hire a DJ. That cost $400. All of this the host had spent months working his ass off so he was able to actually afford it and hold the 'best party ever!' Come the night of the party, weeks of preperation money and organisation, this party is expected to go off! My sister heads off to this massive venue, 'fashionably late' aswell, and no one else is there. Much to their surprise, It's just an empty hall with lights going on and a DJ doing his thing. Then she finds the host and asks the normal questions; 'where is everyone' etc. He is as baffled as my sister was. Not even his best mates had shown up which was even more surprising. Now this is just the most gut-wrenching part of this whole thing. The host then calls his friends. He asks them 'where the hell are you guys?!' and, obviously on loudspeaker an uproar of laughter comes from the person speaking and you can also hear it in the background. He starts crying and everything, absolutely devastated about what has happened. Not only is he out of pocket at $1900 least and knowing that all your friends possibly organised a boycott for this event . When I was told this story i couldn't stomach how harsh and horrible people can be. I never even though this happened, especially on such a large scale as this. TL;DR Host works for months to be able to afford expenses for a party which was expected to have over 120 people in attendance. No one actually attended except for my sister, her friends, the host, his parents and girlfriend. When he called his mates to see when they'd come, they, as well as many other people in the background, just laughed at him and hung upThe worst part about this is that his "friends" had to all get together and sit around waiting for him to call, just so they could laugh in his face..How does a group of people stop 100+ people from going to a party? Something doesn't make sense.For my high school's 5 year anniversary, one enterprising student made a facebook group and went through the yearbook, adding everyone he could possibly find. About 630 of the roughly 700 students from our graduating class joined the group and started in on how everyone was doing, where everyone was living etc. For the actual IRL get-together invite, about 150 people said yes and 300 or so said maybe. The guy who organized it rented out a private room at a bowling alley, paid for a bartender and got a ridiculous amount of food and such, as well as having all 4 yearbooks and putting together a DVD of random videos from sporting events, plays, funny skits from the school news, everything. This guy went all out.
Title says it all, just state your profession and your number one tip - or more. I.E. Boxer/Boxing Coach "If you ever get in a fight, throw your punches in a straight line, not a wide-looping-circle." EDIT: Whoa this thread took off! Thanks everyone for the awesome knowledge! Gotta say some of them are interesting, and some hella funny. Keep it up! I wanna hear more EDIT: Woohoo! First page, first time ever. Thanks again for all the awesome advice everyone, gotta say i'm loving it!Fix/Replace your roof before fixing the interior. If you see a leak starting in a drywall ceiling, poke a small hole in it. The water will drain instead of spreading and causing more damage.Protip: tie a piece of string or twine around a nail or screw and push it into to drywall seam where the leak is to create a hole, and dangle the other end of the string down into the bucket. This lets you collect multiple leaks with one bucket, and you won't have to hear drip.....drip.....drip all night, as the water will travel down the string and into the bucket even at an angle.I'm a lawyer. If you've got a problem, collect evidence. When you testify during the lawsuit, your word means little. You may lose the case due to lack of evidence supporting your side, regardless of what actually happened. I've seen good people, including my own clients, lose cases where I had no doubt they were in the right, just because they had nothing to show for themselves except their own say-so.
Tattoos, having a child, that time you went "I think I can make that jump..." Or "what's the worst that could happen?"Bought a penis-ring to have sex with my ex-GF. The first (and only) time I used it, I set the ring size way too small - basically choked my penis from lack of circulating blood. Completed sex, but the next morning my penis was shriveled (like half its normal flaccid size)and looked like it was covered in really tiny veins everywhere. Went to the ER and it turns out that I caused ischemia in parts of my penis, burst a few blood vessels, and basically destroyed my ability to get an erection for the rest of my life. I am only in my 20's. Edit: I didn’t expect this comment to blow up so much, thank you all for your empathy (and TY for the reddit gold). There are a lot of questions below. This happened three years ago, and my ex broke up with me shortly afterwards. I can still get a semi-erection, maybe 20% of what it was previously if I use viagra. It gets engorged somewhat, but doesn't get 'up' like previously. ED causes a lot of stress, anxiety, worry, etc. no matter what age you are. The worst part was that I really couldn’t confide in anybody what was the source of my stress… my parents especially could see something was wrong whenever I visited, but I just told them that I was upset because my girlfriend broke up with me.
[removed]From mtv.com "A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion. "Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle. "Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, 'I'm going to beat the sh-- out of you when we get home! You wait and see!' " The detective said "Robyn F." then used her cell phone to call her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales, who did not answer. "Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, 'I'm on my way home. Make sure the police are there when I get there.'
Do memes exist? If so, are there deferent ones, or are the same memes just translated? Does trolling exist? Has any English-language internet culture originated in other languages? I think it's easy to forget that the internet is an international and multi-lingual phenomenon, especially with the privilege of being an English speaker. I'm really curious as to whether the same patterns exist in other languages.In Thai, the number 5 is pronounced "ha" - so instead of saying "LOL" or "haha", people just write "55555". So if you see that anywhere on the interwebs, it's not some crazy number cult, just Thai people laughing! Edit: I feel like it's my duty to inform you all that Mashable/The Atlantic have used our comments as inspiration for an article (and they've even called this thread "amazing"!): http://mashable.com/2012/12/12/laugh-online-languages/In Chinese, 5 is "wu", and so it's sometimes used exactly opposite to you - 55555 would be "wuwuwuwuwu", meaning "boohoohoohoohoo", crying.That's like Spanish speakers writing jajajaTIL Asians even laugh in maths.
EDIT 10: Replaced pie charts with columns showing the top percentages EDIT 9: We are back up! Thanks to Ed at Zymic for all the help! EDIT 8: Working with Zymic to get the site back up Last week I setup a survey on a "free" survey account. It was "free" until I tried to retrieve the results. So I promised to make a new one. Here it is. I've been on reddit for a while, and I really enjoy the community. I always wondered who the people of reddit are. So I make a quick survey to find out. This is not a scam. Every single question is optional, you don't have to answer a single question if you don't want to. It's 100% anonymous, I don't ask you a single question about your name or account. You can look through my reddit profile and see that I've been here for a while, and am not just a bot trying to steal data. If you have any questions or suggestions let me know. If you think of any new questions I can add them easily. Now, here's the best part....INSTANT RESULTS!!!! I've created a real-time results page.. That's updated every time someone takes the survey! EDIT: Please upvote if you take the survey, so that others can see it. Thanks! EDIT 2: I am aware that Atheism and Agnostic are not Religions, but there that was the best place to put them. EDIT 3: Results require flash! EDIT 4: Only two people have reported finding the easter egg.....c'mon guys! EDIT 5: Shutting Down Temporarily for troll cleanup EDIT 6: The site has crashed, since it's hosted by some other company, I'm having trouble restoring it. I'll be working on it and get it up as soon as I can, ok it's up, but still being trolled.Thanks, Now I know I'm not unique in any sense.It would be kind of interesting if after answering you could know how many people answered EXACTLY like you.The OP should add an essay question, to help capture our unique individual essence!I'm unique in the aspect that I have a vagina! But that's about it :-(I love how the results page makes it look like I'm doing work! :)
We have to get people out of this habit of defend your team at all costs (teams being Democrats vs Republicans/Progressives vs Conservatives). Most of our elected representatives in Congress on both sides are bought and have no obligation to the rest of us. Until we get all this money out of politics, they will not represent anything but what that money tells them to represent. Just enough voters buy into this Dems vs Cons crap to keep anything from changing anytime soon.This is the root of why this problem is nearly unsolvable.I read a stat somewhere, and I don't remember the exact numbers, but there was a poll about whether voters thought congress was doing a good job: somewhere around 20%. Voters who thought THEIR congressman was doing a good job: about 85%. Every politician sucks except my guy syndrome. The only way to change the government is to vote to change the government, which means the people there. EDIT: I just want to add my personal feeling that the best thing we can do is to vote for a third party (any third party). Any democrat and republican, even if against a certain issue, faces a HUGE amount of pressure from the party itself to vote a certain way, and may find themselves without campaign funds next time they're up for election, which means potentially out of a job.
Things like how to get things cheaper, what you do to people that are rude, etc.I've said this before in another thread, but I used to work in a butter factory. As far as bricked butter is concerned, buy the cheapest shit you can find. It's literally the same stuff. There are like 3 butter factories in the US, and they send them off to get packaged. That's what the company I worked for did. The butter came in 22kg boxes and were put in a giant churner for freshness, and that churner pushed it through the pipes to 16 different labelling machines. We had 200+ labels we would put on them, Land O'Lakes, Crystal, Great Value... Literally same butter, same machines. Have to fill 4 pallets of Great Value today? Put the labels in machine 4 for a few hours. Salted and unsalted, that is the only difference.My sister owns her own bakery and has been saying this for many years.It's not just butter. I work in a frozen food factory (engineering dept, thankfully. The floor is brutal.) We crosspack for about a dozen different brands. The dirty little secret is that each type of frozen food (mexican, italian, asian, whatev) is made by one or a few companies and get shoved into boxes for the big boys. That bargain stuff from the company you've never heard of? Same shit as in the fancy white box, provided it's the same type of product. We all specialize in just a few different lines.
EDIT: Glad I got so many responses, your stories have all been awesome. It's great to see the amount of gold everyone's gettingMy mom is a trucker, this is her story. She was driving through Arizona when she saw what she thought was leaves blowing across the road in the distance. This puzzled her since there's mostly pine trees in northern Arizona. When she finally got to the "leaves" she realized that they were migrating tarantulas, 1000's of them. There were so many of them that her truck was sliding on their guts so she had to slow down. She stopped at the first truck stop and told her co-driver to fuel up (he was sleeping at the time) because she wasn't going to step foot outside after what she just saw. Her co-driver was pissed since it was technically his time off, and he thought she was crazy, until he saw the tarantula guts and legs caked in the inside wheel well of the truck. She also outran a tornado in the midwest. She was about to pull over and take cover until she saw another big rig that was parked on the side of the road get tossed a couple hundred yards like a toy. She called me and told me that she thought she was going to die and wanted her last words to be "I love you" to me. She pulled off the freeway and got to a Wal-Mart, where she ran into the basement where all the staff and customers were taking shelter. After the tornado passed, they stepped out of the basement and into daylight, since the Wal Mart was destroyed.
Surprised no one else has said this. Throwing away left over food instead of eating it later. I've worked in the restaurant industry for years and it's appalling the amount of food that gets thrown away that would be perfectly fine the next day. I constantly pack my leftovers and eat them for lunch.I ate leftovers for lunch nearly 8 years in a row. My lunches were always so much better than the squashed and soggy PBJ that everyone else had. However, up until the last month or so, there was no way to heat anything up. I can eat almost anything cold, but lord, the microwave is magical for taking leftovers to the next level. I could never work at a restaurant because all that waste would drive me nuts. I actually get antsy just thinking about it. That's free food for months, and I could feed the homeless guy on the corner too! TL;DR I like leftovers. Cold or hot, waste them I will not.I eat leftovers but hubby doesn't.. Drives me crazy cause he expects a new meal every night when last nights meal could be just as good reheated today and we saved money.. So leftovers are usually my lunch for the week...
I've talked about this with many people over the years, both in academic and casual contexts, and found only rarely a real answer, but maybe a broader audience will bear fruit. I'm genuinely curious when the last time was any of you spent time analyzing, researching or reasoning out a moral or ethical position you hold, and determined that you were in fact wrong, and took up a new position on whatever issue it concerned.At 32 I decided to no longer hate the Turks. I'm greek and my family was run off their land by the Turks in the 30s, but Turkish people I meet today had nothing to do with that and I just couldn't justify the hate in my mind anymore.How many Greeks still hate turks for similar reasons.? Approximately. Like one percent, 25, 50 or 99?This attitude right here, applied to a global scale, can save the world.I used to think that all drug addicts were degenerate lowlifes. I remember I used to shudder at the sight of them hunched in an alley on my way to school. To me, they were scumbags who couldn't control themselves.
CONCLUSION: I will use Reddit Toolbar. Thanks for the suggestions! So then you have to go back to reddit to find it. edit: Sorry, sheesh. Next time I'll stick it in DAE. (haha, stick it in.) edit2: Really, reddit? Really? This has no business being #1 on the front page. But thanks anyway. edit3: chewp911 posted the same question 3 days ago and now he's sad that he didn't word his question as elegantly nor attractively as I did (I did NOT linkjack him, just a coincidence) ... anyone wanna throw him some pity votes to help brighten his day? Maybe we could get both of these to the top of the front page and piss everyone off! HA! http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bish1/how_often_do_you_open_reddit_links_in_tabs_and/Preferences -> Display links with a reddit toolbar Enjoy :)Or if you don't want to turn the toolbar on but want to use it for a specific link you can type "reddit.com/" directly in front of the url and it will display it.If you use Firefox, check out the much more elegant extension that does the same thing. Edit: There's also a port for Chrome, although I've never used it so I can't speak to its completeness, stability, etc. Edit 2: The experimental version works in Firefox 3.6 if the main download is still broken.Sweet!
[deleted]Where's my Droid. As much as I use some of the other apps (especially the flashlight), I always seem to lose my damn phone in a couch, or god knows where...and it is ALWAYS on vibrate when it happens. So, you text a preselected word or phrase to your phone from a friends phone or what have you, and it automatically turns on the ringer to max volume, and plays until you find it...once you find it, you just hit the found phone button, and the app closes and your ringer settings return to what they were previously. Good stuff. Edit: I use the free version. Obviously the paid version is better (WMD also has the ability to take pictures with front and rear cameras, remotely activate gps, do a remote wipe, can use camera flash to help find it, can white/black list numbers, has a passcode that you can set to keep people from changing your keywords, sim card options, etc. some 'advanced' features are only available in the paid version...and YES there ARE versions of this type of app for the iPhone, but I don't know the names or quality.)Look into Cerberus. Amazing app. Edit: Link
This questions stems from the idea that some Dyson vacuums are so expensive. Are they really that awesome?As a contractor - my Dewalt radio. First tool off the truck, last tool on. Plus it charges batteries too. It doubles as a seat for break time and can survive a fall off the roof. I've had mine for about 10 years now, probably longer than any other tool I own Edit: thanks for all the comments. I tried to reply to most of you. If I missed you I'm sorry. edit: http://www.nationalwholesaletools.com/browseproducts/DeWalt-Heavy-Duty-Worksite-Radio-Charger--(DW911).html. for those who wanted to see the exact model.We have one of these at work (golf course) and things tend to get trashed since we are reckless and break things. It has outlasted the break room TV, 3 riding mowers, and 2 sets of Kobalt Blue tool kits. We have had more people have heart attacks and die on the course than Dewalt radios die.Seriously, Dewalt is probably the best jobsite radio out there. I had three makita radios in a year, then bought the dewalt and the thing is still functional aftre three years and probably gallons of paint spilled on it.
I work from a home office, and this time of year is really slow for my company. Of course, I need to stay close to my computer to respond to emails and calls, but I'd like to find something to do with my time. So Reddit: What can I do with my time at home? I'm a 23 year old American guy who is fairly well rounded (skill and knowledge wise) so you may suggest some things I already know or do, but I'd like any input you guys can get me! I'll update the post as responses roll in. Edit: (8:16 Central Time) Still buried in mail. you guys are awesome. Again- thanks, and keep 'em coming! I'm starting work on a (highly abridged) list, but as several folks have linked, there are many similar lists on reddit and elsewhere.

Edit: Link http://www.examiner.com/article/the-westboro-church-plans-to-picket-the-aurora-shooting-memorial-service Edit 2: According to This Facebook page the memorial is at 6:30 on Sunday at Aurora city hall. Edit 3: Latest informationKansan Here. I just want to say, if you plan on making signs for this thing, make signs that are in complete support of the victims and the survivors of the shooting and make absolutely NO REFERENCE to the WBC being there. Don't even acknowledge them. If you start making the memorial service about THEM, they win. I imagine it is also nice for the families and the survivors to be seeing signs of love and support, rather than political statements against some dumb fucking church in Topeka. I wish I could be there to give my respects. Good luck to you! edit* I mixed up cities and said they were from Wichita. I'm sorry Wichita. I didn't mean it.This is so true. There is absolutely a time for joking and having fun with the WBC, but that time would not be now. Save that for when they just picket colleges etc. Right now at this horrible time in some people's lives is the time to ignore them and show support. Make it about the funeral and the lives lost, NEVER make it about the WBC and your counter-protest.THIS! They picket my high school graduation every year. They are LAWYERS and make their money off of people who say or do the wrong things like threats ect. And it's always good to hear from a fellow Kansan! Rock Chalk Jayhawk?

They have been at it since 1995, and haven't skipped a single day. The look of the website hasn't changed much -- basic HTML, but the 1 paragraph of text below the picture often gives an insight into our universe and modern astronomy. Their forums are pretty cool too. Edit: forgot to mention their awesome archive.I have a program that grabs the daily picture and makes it my desktop background.

No judgement, I'm just here to listen. Edit: Wow guys, it's been a journey. It's 1 AM and I have to be up for work tomorrow. I just want to say how happy I am that you all shared this with me. I'll respond to a few more, then I'll be up and back at it tomorrow. Peace <3 Edit2: I lied about going to sleep. I stayed up longer and read more of your guy's comments. It's actually very moving that you'd share all of this with me and I truly thank you. Unfortunately, I have so many comments that I honestly can't keep up with them all. A lot of them have to do with the same issue, so I strongly suggest you read through the thread and connect with some people that are going through the same thing. I'll do my best to comment on a few more, and I PROMISE to read every single last one of your comments. Even if I don't respond, I want you to know that I did/will read it. Goodnight folks. <3 Edit3: Edit2 bothers me. I want to reply to everything. Some of you deserve recognition and I feel like just reading them isn't enough. I see your problems, and I empathize deeply, I just can't reply to every single one. I'm sorry guys. :( Edit4: THANK YOU to those of you out there who are also replying to people! I noticed some comments I was reading already had some replies. You people are saints. :) Edit5: Follow-up. I'm still responding to some of the comments that are coming in, but I also wanted to mention that a fellow Redditor has made and invited me to moderate r/whatsbotheringyou If you would like, we can respond to some of your problems that you submit there in the form of a text-post. Cheers. <3I'm unhappy because I'm becoming increasingly aware of the enormous flaws in my personality, work ethic, and character that are preventing me from making the most out of this life. There's nothing worse than realizing you've been given so many opportunities and advantages, and squandered them all.There's nothing worse than realizing you've been given so many opportunities and advantages, and squandered them all. There is one worse thing: never realizing you've squandered them all.Coming to that realization is the most difficult part, now take advantage of it. Turn that negative energy into something positive, improve on your flaws, strengthen your work ethic, and begin from now on to make the most out of every day. There's nothing worse than realizing you've been given so many opportunities and advantages, and squandered them all. I have to disagree. It would be much worse to realize you have squandered so many opportunities, then go on to continue letting opportunities slip away in the future.
In light of the recent Canadian bill to legalize prostitution, what are your reasons for/against legalization? Is it that much different then a regulated porn industry, where STDs, physical abuse and drug use may be controlled? *EDIT: link to Canadian bill *EDIT 2: By support, I mean support a political measure or referendum. I'm not referring to whether or not you will want to partake. Similar to the discussion of the legalization of marijuana.i'm quadriplegic. if i ever kill myself, it'll probably be over a lack of intimacy in my life. i could use a professional prostitute to go down on.In Germany prostitution is legal and they even have special prostitutes for disabled persons. see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Germany#For_special_groupsFunny, I work with quadriplegics every day, and I've always thought that I would gladly help arrange that sort of thing if asked (and if it weren't a huge legal risk).It's really not that difficult to hook up with a prostitute. They'll come to you if you can afford it. Be safe, but it could be a great time for you. I highly recommend it.
Hired full time, and I make a good living. My work involves a lot of "data entry", verification, blah blah. I am a programmer at heart and figured out how to make a script do all my work for me. Between co workers, they have a 90% accuracy rating and 60-100 transactions a day completed. I have 99,6% accuracy and over 1.000 records a day. No one knows I do this because everyone's monthly accuracy and transaction count are tallied at the end of the month, which is how we earn our bonus. The scum part is, I get 85-95% of the entire bonus pool, which is a HUGE some of money. Most people are fine with their bonuses because they don't even know how much they would bonus regularly. I'm guessing they get €100-200 bonus a month. They would get a lot more if I didnt bot. So reddit, am I a scumbag? I work about 8 hours a week doing real work, the rest is spent playing games on my phone or reading reddit... Edit: A lot of people are posting that I'm asking for a pat on the back... Nope, I'm asking for the moral delima if my ~90% bonus share is unethical for me to take... Edit2: This post has kept me up all night... hah. So many comments guys! you all are crazy :PEventually someone will realise the over 1000 a day is done by a program, everyone will then lose their jobs as the corportion realises that there is a cheaper way of doing things. But I don't think you are a scumbag for finding the most efficient way to do your job.Absolutely this. You're not a scumbag, but the gravy train will have to end eventually. Your company will likely catch on and make changes to the data entry process.So what you're saying is that he should slow it down a bit to not make it as obvious.that's exactly what I thought, so isn't he a hero of sorts by not exposing his efficient program since he's letting people keep their jobs and "mediocre" bonuses?
Another way to ask this - What is something about the universe/world/reality/whatever that makes you feel uneasy? Something that is an unchangable fact about life that you really, really don't like. Here's mine, as an example: I hate that a huge number of people we meet/interact with will never be seen by us again. I met this ridiculously awesome crazy old guy on vacation one year. He was interesting, and we ran into him a couple times during the whole vacation. The vacation ended, and now there is virtually no way I'll ever see him again.That every single person you know you will see for the very last time at some point. You will likely have no idea when this point comes, and for many of the people you still consider good friends, this may have already passed.This is hard to stomach. There are so many people in my life, my family, my SO, my friends, that I always assume I'll be able to see again, but I'll never know if that's true or not. Maybe I'll see them a thousand times, maybe ten, maybe once and maybe never again. For some people in my life, I can't cope with that idea.This one is terrifying me right now...This one really gets me. I had a best friend that died of a heroin overdose last year, and the last time I saw her, I was being irresponsible and skipped out on work so I could hang out with her for the night. We were having fun and drank a little bit at the end of the night, ended up taking some group pictures with us and another friend. Those are the only pictures I have of her with me. I had no idea that that was the last time I was ever going to see her and I got to see her that one last time and by some random stroke of luck, get the only pictures I have of us together because I chose to be irresponsible and say fuck work for that day. I have never been happier to make a "bad" decision than I have been for that, fuck I'd skip work all year if I could see her again. She overdosed about 2 months later, out of nowhere. I found out from the messages on Facebook and it felt like my stomach just disappeared, like I suddenly became empty inside. Life has never been so horrifyingly real and I still get panic attacks sometimes when I think about her, but god damn am I happy I got those pictures from that last time we ever saw each other.
When I was in grade 12 English class we had been reading Death of a Salesman. It was the first class of the day and the Teacher was late. It was odd, but no biggie, so the class just bullshitted to pass the time. Five minutes pass, then ten, when I finally spoke up "Hey, HEY! We should just keep reading from where we left off yesterday guys." I was a very charismatic kid. Probably the most agreeable guy in school, the friends with everyone type, so everyone actually went along with it. It's a play, so everyone who had a 'role' the day before just resumed it and we kept reading. Well, 5-10 minutes later the Vice Principal comes in. He was obviously surprised that we were doing work, but he didn't mention it. He just told us our teacher was dealing with a personal issue and she would be a little while longer. 10-20 minutes more passed and she finally showed up. When she opened the door and saw us there, all reading and paying attention, she burst right into tears of happiness. She died a couple years later from Cancer, way too young. She was only 40. Around the time of her death I found out that was the day she was got her diagnosis/prognosis. So on one of the worst days of her life, our class helped make it just a little better. So, reddit, let's hear your stories.At the gym I go to there's a guy who was very overweight and he always seemed awkward and always in the way. I didn't talk to him apart from the occasional 'how's it going?' On on occasion one of the meat-heads at the gym started ragging on this guy for being in the way again and said something to the effect of, "You're too fat to be here, go home so we don't have to look at you anymore." I told the meat-heat to leave the guy alone and to give him some slack because he was at the gym working out at least trying to make a change for the better and that he had just as much of a right/reason to be there as the meat-head did. A few months later the guy came up and thanked me. He said he probably would've quit that day had I not said something. He still works out at the gym regularly. He's lost a good amount of weight but still has a long way to. He got a personal trainer for a while so he's a lot more confident about his workout and using all of the machines.I hate asshole gym people. They hate fat people for being fat and then complain when they enter a gym to get healthy. Upvote for standing up for what is right.
Everybody likes snacks, right? Some of us like chips, others like fruit, or yogurt. Well, my wife likes croutons. Frozen croutons to be exact and she tries to hide it like an alcoholic hides bottles of vodka. Where does she hide the croutons? In the freezer. At first I'd put them in the pantry when we get home from the grocery store, but they'd always end up in the freezer. I'd be like, "Uh, hon, what's up with the croutons in the freezer?" and she'd act like she had no idea what I was talking about. Now here's the thing, I've tried them and now I'm addicted to them too. So now I openly eat cold croutons out of the freezer as a snack, and she tells me what a weirdo I am while she eats half the bag with me. No idea why she's embarassed to admit what a genius she is for discovering such an awesome snack. BTW, the best kind is Chatham Village garlic and cheese flavor.When they finish freezing if I get addicted to them I have you to blame."and she tells me what a weirdo I am while she eats half the bag with me.

So basically she found that six papers were in some way plagiarized and let the class know that if those people admitted they plagiarized they would lose a letter grade but get to write the paper again. If they didn't respond they would get penalized (aka Fail the course and possibly get expelled from the university). She received 19 e-mails back of people confessing, most of which were never even guilty of plagiarism in the first place. Funny thing is that only five of the six people who actually cheated responded. One kid never came to class again, and ended up getting severely punished by the university. What other strange cause and effect situations have you witnessed? TL;DR- those stretch marks eventually turn pearly white and when they wrap around a beautiful, warm, tan thigh they almost look like lightning bolts and I think it is incredibly sexy and I want to kiss from your knees to your hips. EDIT: MmmmWhen I lived in a dorm at college, someone pulled the fire alarm as a prank on his roommate who was having sex with his girlfriend. The fire team, obligated to come out and check the building, found an unexpected situation on their hands when they arrived. The RA for each floor would enter the building with an officer and check all the rooms. On the floor above me, they found a girl who had overdosed on medication in an apparent suicide attempt seizing in her bathroom. She was rushed to the hospital and they saved her life. She didn't end up returning to school, but her parents were so grateful that they rewarded the student who pulled the prank the $500 he was fined for falsely pulling the alarm. We all knew it was a prank and were joking with the guy and his roommate and girlfriend outside. It was terrifying when a legitimate emergency was uncovered.Wow that is incredibly fortunate.deus ex machina.
